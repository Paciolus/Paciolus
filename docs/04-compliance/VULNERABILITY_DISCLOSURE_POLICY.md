---

## 2. How to Report

### 2.1 Primary Channel

**Email:** security@paciolus.com

Send vulnerability reports to this address. For sensitive reports, you may encrypt your email using our PGP key (available at https://paciolus.com/.well-known/security.txt).

**Machine-readable disclosure metadata** is published at the canonical URL [`https://paciolus.com/.well-known/security.txt`](https://paciolus.com/.well-known/security.txt) (RFC 9116). This file references our [Trust page](https://paciolus.com/trust) as the human-readable security policy.

### 2.2 Alternative Channels

| Channel | Address | Use Case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Security email | security@paciolus.com | All vulnerability reports (primary) |
| security.txt | https://paciolus.com/.well-known/security.txt | Machine-readable contact, policy link ([Trust page](https://paciolus.com/trust)), and PGP key (RFC 9116) |
| GitHub Security Advisories | Via GitHub repository (if public) | Code-level vulnerabilities |

### 2.3 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before coordinated disclosure (Section 7)
- ❌ Do not report via social media, public forums, or support channels
- ❌ Do not attempt to access other users' data or accounts
- ❌ Do not perform destructive testing or denial of service

---

## 3. What to Include

A useful vulnerability report includes:

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Description** | What is the vulnerability? What component is affected? | ✅ Yes |
| **Steps to reproduce** | Detailed steps another engineer can follow to reproduce the issue | ✅ Yes |
| **Impact assessment** | What could an attacker do? What data is at risk? | ✅ Yes |
| **Affected URL/endpoint** | Specific URL, API endpoint, or component | ✅ Yes |
| **Proof of concept** | Screenshots, HTTP request/response, code snippet | Recommended |
| **Suggested fix** | How you think the issue could be fixed | Optional |
| **Your contact info** | Email or preferred communication channel | ✅ Yes |
| **Severity estimate** | Your assessment of severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) | Optional |

### 3.1 Example Report

```
Subject: [Vulnerability Report] IDOR in /api/clients/{id}

Description:
The GET /api/clients/{id} endpoint does not verify that the
authenticated user owns the requested client record. An authenticated
user can access any client by iterating client IDs.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Register two accounts (user A and user B)
2. As user A, create a client (note the client_id in response)
3. As user B, send GET /api/clients/{client_id_from_step_2}
4. User B receives user A's client data

Impact:
Any authenticated user can read any other user's client metadata
(company name, industry, fiscal year end). Financial data is not
affected (Zero-Storage architecture).

Affected endpoint: GET /api/clients/{id}
Severity estimate: High (cross-tenant data access)
```

## 4. Safe Harbor

### 4.1 Our Commitment

Paciolus will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:

1. **Act in good faith** — Research is conducted to identify and report vulnerabilities, not to exploit them.
2. **Avoid harm** — No destruction of data, disruption of service, or access to other users' accounts.
3. **Follow this policy** — Report through designated channels and allow reasonable time for remediation.
4. **Do not disclose prematurely** — Vulnerabilities are not shared publicly before coordinated disclosure.

### 4.2 Legal Protection

We consider security research conducted consistent with this policy to be:

- **Authorized** under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- **Authorized** under equivalent international laws (e.g., UK Computer Misuse Act)
- **Exempt** from DMCA Section 1201 claims related to circumvention of security measures

We will not file complaints against researchers acting in compliance with this policy.

### 4.3 Limitations

Safe harbor does **not** extend to:

- Testing that causes service degradation or data loss
- Accessing, modifying, or deleting other users' data
- Social engineering of Paciolus employees or customers
- Physical security testing
- Research on third-party services (report to those providers directly)

## 5. Response Timeline

| Stage | SLA | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| **Acknowledgment** | 2 business days | We confirm receipt and assign a tracking ID |
| **Initial assessment** | 5 business days | We validate the report and assign severity |
| **Status update** | Every 10 business days | We provide progress updates during remediation |
| **Fix deployed** | Depends on severity (Section 6) | Fix deployed to production |
| **Disclosure coordination** | 90 days from report (default) | Coordinated public disclosure if applicable (Section 7) |
| **Reporter notification** | Within 2 business days of fix deployment | We notify you that the fix is live |

### 5.1 What to Expect

After you submit a report:

1. **Acknowledgment email** with a tracking ID (e.g., `PACIOLUS-VDP-2026-001`)
2. **Assessment notification** confirming whether the report is valid and its assigned severity
3. **Periodic updates** if remediation takes longer than 10 business days
4. **Resolution notification** when the fix is deployed
5. **Credit offer** (with your consent) in our security advisory (Section 9)

---

## 6. Severity Classification

We use the following severity classification aligned with CVSS v3.1 guidance:

| Severity | CVSS Range | Definition | Remediation SLA |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Critical** | 9.0–10.0 | Remote code execution, authentication bypass, Zero-Storage violation, credential database exfiltration | 48 hours |
| **High** | 7.0–8.9 | Cross-tenant data access (IDOR), privilege escalation, CSRF on critical actions, SQL injection | 1 week |
| **Medium** | 4.0–6.9 | Stored XSS, information disclosure (non-credential), rate limit bypass, CSRF on non-critical actions | 2 weeks |
| **Low** | 0.1–3.9 | Reflected XSS (requires user interaction), verbose error messages, missing security headers | Next release |
| **Informational** | 0.0 | Best practice suggestions, hardening recommendations | Backlog (no SLA) |

### 6.1 Zero-Storage Context

Paciolus's [Zero-Storage Architecture](./ZERO_STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md) reduces the impact of many vulnerability classes:

| Vulnerability | Traditional Impact | Paciolus Impact |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| SQL injection (read) | Financial data exposure | Metadata only (credentials, client names) |
| Server-side request forgery | Internal data access | No financial data on server to access |
| Backup file exposure | Full customer data | Metadata only (no financial data in backups) |
| Log injection | Financial data in logs | Log sanitizer prevents financial data logging |

This does **not** reduce the severity of vulnerabilities affecting authentication, authorization, or credential storage.

## 7. Disclosure Coordination

### 7.1 Default Timeline

| Event | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Report received | Day 0 |
| Fix deployed | Per severity SLA (Section 6) |
| Coordinated disclosure | 90 days from initial report (default) |

### 7.2 Disclosure Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Coordinated disclosure** (default) | We publish a security advisory after the fix is deployed. Reporter credited (with consent). |
| **Silent fix** | Fix deployed without public advisory. Used for low-severity issues or informational reports. Reporter notified privately. |
| **Accelerated disclosure** | If the vulnerability is already being actively exploited or publicly known, we may disclose before 90 days. |

### 7.3 Researcher Disclosure Rights

After our remediation SLA has passed:
- If we have **not** fixed the issue within the agreed timeline, the researcher may disclose publicly after providing 14 days' additional notice.
- If we have deployed a fix, we will coordinate disclosure timing with the researcher.
- We ask that researchers allow at least 7 days after fix deployment before independent disclosure, to allow users to update.

## 8. Exclusions

### 8.1 Non-Qualifying Reports

The following are typically not eligible for acknowledgment:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Known issues** | Vulnerabilities already reported and in remediation |
| **Theoretical attacks** | Reports without proof of concept or reproducible steps |
| **Best practices** | Missing headers on non-sensitive pages, cookie flags on non-auth cookies |
| **Scanner output** | Automated scan results without manual validation |
| **Third-party issues** | Vulnerabilities in Stripe, Vercel, Render, or other providers |
| **Social engineering** | Phishing, pretexting, or physical security |
| **Denial of service** | Volume-based attacks, resource exhaustion attacks |
| **Spam/email** | SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration suggestions without demonstrated exploit |

### 8.2 Testing Boundaries

Researchers must:
- Use only accounts you own or have explicit permission to test
- Not degrade service availability or performance
- Not access, modify, or delete other users' data
- Not perform automated scanning at a rate exceeding 10 requests/second
- Stop testing immediately if you inadvertently access another user's data (report the access path)
