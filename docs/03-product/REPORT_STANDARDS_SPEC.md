## 1. Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Report** | Any PDF document generated by Paciolus |
| **Classical Report** | Full-length diagnostic report (TB Diagnostic, Financial Statements) — uses ornamental styling |
| **Testing Memo** | Tool-specific workpaper (JE, AP, Payroll, Revenue, AR, Fixed Asset, Inventory) — uses standardized memo template |
| **Custom Memo** | Specialized workpaper with non-standard section flow (TWM, Bank Rec, Multi-Period, Sampling, Currency) |

| **Cover Block** | The title/metadata area at the top of page 1 (not a separate page) |
| **Intelligence Stamp** | Machine-generated provenance line identifying generator, timestamp, client, period |

---

## 2. Report Categories

All reports fall into exactly one category. The category determines which standard elements apply.

| Category | Reports | Count |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **A — Classical** | TB Diagnostic Intelligence Summary, Financial Statements (BS + IS + CFS) | 2 |
| **B — Testing Memo** | JE, AP, Payroll, Revenue, AR Aging, Fixed Asset, Inventory | 7 |
| **C — Custom Memo** | Three-Way Match, Bank Reconciliation, Multi-Period, Statistical Sampling, Multi-Currency | 5 |
| **D — Diagnostic Extension** | Preflight, Population Profile, Expense Category, Accrual Completeness, Flux Expectations | 5 |
| **E — Engagement** | Anomaly Summary | 1 |

**Total: 20 reports.**

---

## 3. Cover Page Standard

All reports use an inline cover block on page 1 (no separate cover page). The cover block contains the following elements in order:

### 3.1 Cover Block Elements (top to bottom)

| # | Element | Style | Required | Notes |
|---|---------|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Logo** | Centered, max 1.2" x 0.4" | ALL | Paciolus logo. Omit only if logo asset unavailable. |
| 2 | **Report Title** | `ReportTitle` (24pt) | ALL | Sentence case. See title table in 3.2. |
| 3 | **Client Name** | `ReportSubtitle` (11pt) | ALL | Omit line entirely if no client context. |
| 4 | **Date and Reference** | `ReportRef` (9pt italic) | ALL | Format: `{classical_date} . {reference_number}` |
| 5 | **Double Rule** | Gold (#B8934C), 2pt thick + 0.5pt thin | ALL | 0.05" vertical gap between rules. |

### 3.2 Title Table

Every report has a canonical title. Generators MUST use these exact strings.

| Report | Canonical Title |
|--------|----------------|
| TB Diagnostic | Diagnostic Intelligence Summary |
| Financial Statements | Financial Statements |
| JE Testing | Journal Entry Testing Memo |
| AP Testing | AP Payment Testing Memo |
| Payroll Testing | Payroll & Employee Testing Memo |
| Revenue Testing | Revenue Recognition Testing Memo |
| AR Aging | Accounts Receivable Aging Analysis Memo |
| Fixed Asset Testing | Fixed Asset Register Analysis Memo |
| Inventory Testing | Inventory Register Analysis Memo |
| Three-Way Match | Three-Way Match Validator Memo |
| Bank Reconciliation | Bank Reconciliation Memo |
| Multi-Period | Analytical Procedures Memo |
| Statistical Sampling | Statistical Sampling Memo |
| Multi-Currency | Multi-Currency Conversion Memo |
| Preflight | Data Quality Pre-Flight Report |

| Expense Category | Expense Category Analytical Procedures |
| Accrual Completeness | Accrual Completeness Estimator |
| Flux Expectations | ISA 520 Analytical Procedures -- Expectation Documentation |
| Anomaly Summary | Anomaly Summary Report |

### 3.3 Reference Number Format

All reports use `generate_reference_number()` with a domain-specific prefix:

| Report | Prefix | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| TB Diagnostic | `PAC-` | `PAC-20260224-A3F2` |
| Financial Statements | `PAC-` | `PAC-20260224-B1C4` |
| JE Testing | `JET-` | `JET-20260224-D5E6` |
| AP Testing | `APT-` | `APT-20260224-F7G8` |
| Payroll Testing | `PRT-` | `PRT-20260224-H9I0` |
| Revenue Testing | `RVT-` | `RVT-20260224-J1K2` |
| AR Aging | `ARA-` | `ARA-20260224-L3M4` |
| Fixed Asset Testing | `FAT-` | `FAT-20260224-N5O6` |
| Inventory Testing | `INV-` | `INV-20260224-P7Q8` |
| Three-Way Match | `TWM-` | `TWM-20260224-R9S0` |
| Bank Reconciliation | `REC-` | `REC-20260224-T1U2` |
| Multi-Period | `APC-` | `APC-20260224-V3W4` |
| Statistical Sampling | `SSM-` | `SSM-20260224-X5Y6` |
| Multi-Currency | `CCM-` | `CCM-20260224-Z7A8` |
| Preflight | `PFL-` | `PFL-20260224-B9C0` |
| Population Profile | `PPR-` | `PPR-20260224-D1E2` |
| Expense Category | `ECA-` | `ECA-20260224-F3G4` |
| Accrual Completeness | `ACE-` | `ACE-20260224-H5I6` |
| Flux Expectations | `FEX-` | `FEX-20260224-J7K8` |
| Anomaly Summary | `ANS-` | `ANS-20260224-L9M0` |

**Migration note:** Diagnostic extension memos currently use hardcoded workpaper codes (`WP-PF-001`, etc.). These MUST migrate to dynamic `generate_reference_number()` with the prefixes above.

**Migration note:** Multi-Currency currently uses the default `PAC-` prefix. It MUST migrate to `CCM-`.

### 3.4 Date Format

All reports use `format_classical_date()`: `24 February 2026`

### 3.5 Eliminated Elements

The following elements from the current Classical reports are **removed** from the unified standard:

| Element | Current Location | Reason |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Spaced-letter headers (`E X E C U T I V E   S U M M A R Y`) | TB Diagnostic, Financial Statements | Visual noise; replaced by standard section headers |
| Section ornament (`--- diamond ---`) | TB Diagnostic, Financial Statements | Ornamental; not professional workpaper standard |
| 28pt title size | TB Diagnostic, Financial Statements | Unified to 24pt across all reports |

---

## 4. Header and Footer Standard

### 4.1 Page Header (every page except page 1)

| Element | Position | Style | Content |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| Left rule | Full width | Gold 0.5pt | Horizontal rule |
| Left text | Below rule, left-aligned | 8pt Times-Roman, OBSIDIAN_500 | Report title (abbreviated if >50 chars) |
| Right text | Below rule, right-aligned | 8pt Times-Roman, OBSIDIAN_500 | Reference number |

Page 1 has the cover block instead of the header.

### 4.2 Page Footer (every page)

| Element | Position | Style | Content |
|---------|----------|-------|---------|
| Page number | Center, 0.5" from bottom | 9pt Times-Roman, OBSIDIAN_500 | `-- {n} --` |
| Zero-Storage line | Center, 0.35" from bottom | 7pt Times-Roman, OBSIDIAN_500 | `Zero-Storage Architecture: Financial data processed in-memory and never stored.` |

### 4.3 Watermark

**Decision: NO watermark.** The current "Particularis de Computis" watermark on Classical reports is eliminated. Watermarks reduce readability and are inconsistent across report types.

---

## 5. Typography Scale

All reports use a single unified type scale. No font outside this table is permitted.

| Token | Font | Size | Weight | Color | Usage |
|-------|------|------|--------|-------|-------|

---

## 6. Color Palette

Reports use exactly these named colors. Hex values MUST match.

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `OBSIDIAN_DEEP` | #1A1A1A | Primary text, titles, section headers |
| `OBSIDIAN_600` | #424242 | Subsection headers |

| `OATMEAL_PAPER` | #F5F4F0 | Banner backgrounds, alternating row tint |
| `LEDGER_RULE` | #D5D0C8 | Table row separators |
| `WHITE` | #FFFFFF | Page background |

### 6.1 Prohibited Colors

No other colors are permitted. Specifically:
- No `OBSIDIAN_700` backgrounds on table headers (current deviation in currency/flux memos)
- No `OATMEAL` (#EBE9E4) text on dark backgrounds (current deviation in currency memo tables)
- Grid-style table borders are prohibited

---

## 7. Section Naming Rules

### 7.1 Numbering

All content sections use Roman numerals: `I.`, `II.`, `III.`, etc.

Sections that are structural (not content) do NOT receive Roman numerals:
- Disclaimer banner (if present — rendered before Section I)
- Proof Summary (rendered between Scope and Methodology)
- Workpaper Sign-Off
- Intelligence Stamp
- Disclaimer

### 7.2 Case

Section titles are **ALL CAPS**: `I. SCOPE`, `II. METHODOLOGY`, `III. RESULTS SUMMARY`.

### 7.3 Standard Section Names

Where a section serves a common purpose, use the canonical name:

| Purpose | Canonical Name | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| What data was analyzed | `SCOPE` | Always Section I |
| How analysis was performed | `METHODOLOGY` | |
| Aggregate outcomes | `RESULTS SUMMARY` | |
| Individual flagged items | `KEY FINDINGS` | Conditional — omit if no findings |
| Practitioner judgment area | `FOR PRACTITIONER ASSESSMENT` | Anomaly Summary only |
| Final summary | `CONCLUSION` | Always the last numbered section |

Domain-specific section names (e.g., `MATCH RESULTS`, `RECONCILIATION RESULTS`, `DESIGN PARAMETERS`) are permitted when they replace one of the standard names. They MUST still follow the numbering and casing rules.

### 7.4 Section Ordering

Sections MUST appear in this order. Optional sections are skipped, not renumbered.

1. Disclaimer Banner (if present, before Section I — no number)
2. Practitioner Notice (if present — no number, Flux Expectations only)
3. `I. SCOPE`
4. Proof Summary (no number — testing tools with proof adapters only)
5. `II. METHODOLOGY` or domain-equivalent
6. `III. RESULTS SUMMARY` or domain-equivalent
7. `IV. KEY FINDINGS` or domain-equivalent (conditional)
8. Additional domain sections (V, VI, etc.)
9. `{N}. CONCLUSION`
10. Workpaper Sign-Off (no number)
11. Intelligence Stamp (no number)
12. Disclaimer (no number)

---

## 8. Required Sections Matrix

`R` = Required, `C` = Conditional, `—` = Not applicable, `O` = Optional

| Section | Cat A (Classical) | Cat B (Testing) | Cat C (Custom) | Cat D (Diag Ext) | Cat E (Engagement) |
|---------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Cover Block | R | R | R | R | R |

### 8.1 Proof Summary Applicability

Proof Summary is **required** for tools with proof adapters:

| Tool | Has Proof Adapter | Proof Summary |
|------|:-:|:-:|
| JE Testing | Yes | R |
| AP Testing | Yes | R |
| Payroll Testing | Yes | R |
| Revenue Testing | Yes | R |
| AR Aging | Yes | R |
| Fixed Asset Testing | Yes | R |
| Inventory Testing | Yes | R |
| Three-Way Match | Yes | R |
| Bank Reconciliation | Yes | R |
| Multi-Period | No | — |
| Statistical Sampling | No | — |
| Multi-Currency | No | — |
| Preflight | No | — |
| Population Profile | No | — |
| Expense Category | No | — |
| Accrual Completeness | No | — |
| Flux Expectations | No | — |
| Anomaly Summary | No | — |

### 8.2 Practitioner Notice Applicability

Only Flux Expectations memo includes a Practitioner Notice (pre-scope banner documenting that expectation narratives are authored entirely by the practitioner, not generated by Paciolus).

---

## 9. Non-Committal Language Policy

### 9.1 Mandatory Disclaimer Text

Every report MUST include the following disclaimer as the final element (after Intelligence Stamp):

> This {domain_noun} documents automated {domain_verb} procedures per {framework_reference}. Results represent data anomalies identified through analytics and are not conclusions regarding internal control effectiveness, fraud, or material misstatement risk. The auditor must evaluate each flagged item in the context of the engagement and perform additional procedures as necessary per professional standards. This document does not constitute audit evidence sufficient to support an opinion without corroborating procedures. Generated by Paciolus -- Zero-Storage Audit Intelligence.

Where:
- `{domain_noun}` = "memo" for Categories B/C/D, "report" for Categories A/E
- `{domain_verb}` = domain description (e.g., "journal entry testing", "data quality assessment")
- `{framework_reference}` = ISA/PCAOB references relevant to the tool (see Framework Citation Policy)

### 9.2 Anomaly Summary Additional Banner

The Anomaly Summary (Category E) additionally requires a prominent disclaimer banner at the top AND bottom of the report:

> DATA ANALYTICS REPORT -- NOT AN AUDIT COMMUNICATION. This report lists data anomalies detected through automated testing. It does not constitute an audit opinion, internal control assessment, or management letter per ISA 265/PCAOB AS 1305. The auditor must perform additional procedures and provide all deficiency classifications.

Rendered in `BannerText` style (10pt Times-Bold, CLAY) on `OATMEAL_PAPER` background with 6pt padding.

### 9.3 Prohibited Language

The following phrases MUST NOT appear in any report output:

| Prohibited | Replacement |
|-----------|-------------|
| "We found" / "We identified" | "The analysis identified" / "Testing detected" |
| "Material weakness" | Never used — auditor judgment |
| "Significant deficiency" | Never used — auditor judgment |
| "Audit opinion" | Never used |
| "We recommend" | "The practitioner may consider" |
| "This proves" / "This confirms" | "This indicates" / "This suggests" |
| "Error" (for flagged items) | "Anomaly" / "Flagged item" / "Exception" |
| "Fraud" (as conclusion) | "Fraud risk indicator" / "Anomaly consistent with fraud risk" |
| "Clean" / "No issues" | "No anomalies detected within tested parameters" |

### 9.4 Qualifier Requirements

Every finding narrative MUST include at least one qualifier:

- "...within the parameters tested"
- "...based on the data provided"
- "...subject to practitioner evaluation"
- "...per the analytical procedures applied"

---

## 10. Source Transparency Policy

### 10.1 Source File Identification

Every report that processes an uploaded file MUST identify the source in the SCOPE section:

> **Source Document:** {original_filename}

If a client name or document title is available, include both:

> **Source Document:** {document_title} (`{original_filename}`)

### 10.2 No Fabricated Metadata

If the platform does not know the document title (e.g., the user uploaded `data.csv`), display only the filename. Never fabricate or guess titles.

### 10.3 Period Identification

The analysis period MUST be stated in SCOPE. Format: `Period: {start_date} to {end_date}` or `Period: As of {date}` for point-in-time analyses.

If the period cannot be determined from the data, state: `Period: As provided by the practitioner (not independently verified)`.

---

## 11. Framework Citation Policy

### 11.1 Citation Format

Framework references follow this pattern:

> {Body} {Standard Number} ({Standard Name})

Examples:
- `ISA 530 (Audit Sampling)`
- `PCAOB AS 2315 (Audit Sampling)`
- `ASC 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)`
- `IAS 21 (The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates)`

### 11.2 Dual-Framework Convention

Where both ISA and PCAOB/US GAAP standards apply, cite both with a slash:

> ISA 530 (Audit Sampling) / PCAOB AS 2315 (Audit Sampling)

### 11.3 Required Citations Per Report

| Report | Required Framework Citations |
|--------|------------------------------|
| TB Diagnostic | ISA 520, ISA 315 |
| Financial Statements | ASC 230 / IAS 7 (Cash Flow), IAS 1 (Presentation) |
| JE Testing | PCAOB AS 1215, ISA 530 |
| AP Testing | ISA 240, ISA 500, PCAOB AS 2401 |
| Payroll Testing | ISA 240, ISA 500, PCAOB AS 2401 |
| Revenue Testing | ISA 240, ISA 500, ASC 606 / IFRS 15 |
| AR Aging | ISA 500, ISA 540 |
| Fixed Asset Testing | ISA 500, ISA 540, IAS 16 / ASC 360 |
| Inventory Testing | ISA 500, ISA 540, IAS 2 / ASC 330 |
| Three-Way Match | ISA 500, ISA 505 |
| Bank Reconciliation | ISA 500, ISA 505, PCAOB AS 2310 |
| Multi-Period | ISA 520, PCAOB AS 2305 |
| Statistical Sampling | ISA 530, PCAOB AS 2315 |
| Multi-Currency | IAS 21 |
| Preflight | ISA 500, ISA 330 |
| Population Profile | ISA 520, ISA 530 |
| Expense Category | ISA 520 |
| Accrual Completeness | ISA 520 |
| Flux Expectations | ISA 520, ISA 330 |
| Anomaly Summary | ISA 265 (referenced only in disclaimer — platform does NOT classify deficiencies) |

### 11.4 Citation Placement

Framework citations appear in:
1. The **SCOPE** or **METHODOLOGY** section (first mention, full form)
2. The **Disclaimer** (as `{framework_reference}` parameter)
3. Individual finding narratives (short form: `per ISA 530`)

---

## 12. Signoff Policy

### 12.1 Standard Signoff Block

All reports include a workpaper sign-off section as the last content element before the Intelligence Stamp.

Layout:

```
[LedgerRule]
              Name            Date
Prepared By:  {name}          {date}
Reviewed By:  {name}          {date}
```

Column widths: 1.2" / 3.0" / 2.0". Font: `TableHeader` for header row, `TableCell` for data rows.

### 12.2 Default Behavior

| Field | Default | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Prepared By — Name | Current user's display name | Auto-populated from session |
| Prepared By — Date | Report generation date | Auto-populated via `format_classical_date()` |
| Reviewed By — Name | Empty | Left blank for manual completion |
| Reviewed By — Date | Empty | Left blank for manual completion |

### 12.3 Rationale

The "Reviewed By" field is intentionally blank. Review sign-off is an auditor judgment act that cannot be automated. Pre-populating it would misrepresent the review status of the workpaper.

### 12.4 Anomaly Summary Exception

The Anomaly Summary signoff is **entirely blank** (both Prepared By and Reviewed By) because it is an engagement-level aggregation that the practitioner must claim ownership of.

---

## 13. Table Styling Standard

### 13.1 General Rules

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Header font | `TableHeader` (Times-Bold 9pt) |
| Header text color | OBSIDIAN_DEEP |
| Header background | None (transparent) |
| Header bottom rule | 1pt, OBSIDIAN_DEEP |
| Data font | `TableCell` (Times-Roman 9pt) or `TableNumeric` (Courier 9pt) |
| Row separator | 0.25pt, LEDGER_RULE |
| Vertical rules | None |
| Cell padding | 3pt top, 3pt bottom |
| Alternating rows | Required — OATMEAL_PAPER tint on even rows |
| Left column padding | 0pt (flush left) |

### 13.2 Numeric Column Rules

- All monetary values right-aligned
- All monetary values use Courier (`TableNumeric`)
- Negative values in parentheses: `(1,234.56)` not `-1,234.56`
- Thousands separator: comma
- Decimal places: 2 (monetary), as-needed (ratios/percentages)

### 13.3 Prohibited Table Styles

| Prohibited | Current Location | Replacement |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Dark header background (OBSIDIAN_700) | `currency_memo_generator.py` | Transparent header with bottom rule |
| GRID line style | `currency_memo_generator.py`, `flux_expectations_memo.py` | Ledger rules only |
| White text on dark headers | `currency_memo_generator.py` | OBSIDIAN_DEEP text, no background |

---

## 14. Page Layout Standard

### 14.1 Margins

All reports use identical margins:

| Edge | Size |
|------|------|
| Top | 1.0" |
| Bottom | 0.85" |
| Left | 0.75" |
| Right | 0.75" |

**Migration note:** Current margins vary between 0.75"--1.0" top and 0.75"--1.0" bottom. All MUST converge to these values.

### 14.2 Page Size

Letter (8.5" x 11"). No other page sizes are supported.

### 14.3 Content Width

Usable width: 8.5" - 0.75" - 0.75" = **7.0"**

---

## 15. Resolved Decisions

All decisions resolved by CEO on 24 Feb 2026.

| # | Decision | Resolution | Impact |
|---|----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Logo on cover block | **Include** — centered Paciolus logo on all 20 reports | Logo asset added to `build_cover_block()`. Max 1.2" x 0.4". |
| 2 | Alternating row tint | **Always apply** — OATMEAL_PAPER tint on even rows in all tables | Universal readability improvement. No per-generator opt-out. |
| 3 | Classical report downgrade | **Full convergence** — TB Diagnostic and Financial Statements lose all ornamental styling | Eliminates watermark, spaced-letter headers, ornament, 28pt title, custom disclaimer. One style system for all 20 reports. `create_classical_styles()` will be retired entirely. |

**No unresolved decisions remain. This spec is APPROVED for implementation.**
