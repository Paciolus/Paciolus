## 8. Professional Standards Compliance

### 8.1 Nature of the Platform

Paciolus is a **data analytics and diagnostic tool** designed to assist financial professionals with structured data analysis workflows. Paciolus is **not** audit software, and its outputs do **not** constitute audit evidence, audit opinions, or assurance communications under any professional standards framework.

### 8.2 Diagnostic Workspace

The Engagement Workspace feature ("Diagnostic Workspace") provides workflow organization capabilities including:

- Engagement metadata tracking (client, period, materiality thresholds)
- Follow-up item tracking (narrative descriptions only)
- Workpaper index generation (document register and cross-references)
- Diagnostic package export (anomaly summary PDF, workpaper index, manifest)

The Diagnostic Workspace is a **workflow management tool only**. It does not:

- Generate, evaluate, or classify audit findings
- Produce management letters or audit communications
- Assess internal control effectiveness
- Classify deficiencies as Material Weaknesses or Significant Deficiencies
- Provide assurance opinions of any kind
- Store or retain client financial data

### 8.3 Professional Judgment Disclaimer

All analytical results generated by Paciolus represent **data anomalies identified through automated analytics**. These results are not conclusions regarding:

- Internal control effectiveness
- Fraud risk or occurrence
- Material misstatement risk
- Financial statement accuracy or completeness

The interpretation, evaluation, and classification of all analytical results remains the **sole responsibility of the qualified practitioner**. Users must apply professional judgment in accordance with applicable standards (ISA, PCAOB AS, AICPA AU-C) when evaluating platform outputs.

### 8.4 No Substitute for Professional Procedures

Platform outputs do not constitute sufficient appropriate audit evidence under ISA 500, PCAOB AS 1105, or equivalent standards. Users must perform additional corroborating procedures as required by the applicable professional standards framework before reaching any conclusions based on platform outputs.

### 8.5 Materiality Thresholds

Materiality thresholds set within the Diagnostic Workspace are user-configured inputs for data filtering purposes only. The platform does not determine, recommend, or validate materiality levels. The determination of appropriate materiality thresholds remains the responsibility of the practitioner in accordance with ISA 320/PCAOB AS 2105.

### 8.6 Zero-Storage Architecture

Paciolus operates on a Zero-Storage architecture for financial data:

- Uploaded financial data (trial balances, journals, payment registers, etc.) is processed in-memory only
- No client financial data is persisted to any database or file system
- Only engagement metadata (client name, period dates, materiality settings) and narrative follow-up items are stored
- Follow-up items contain **narrative descriptions only** — no account numbers, monetary amounts, or personally identifiable information

### 8.7 Export Packages

Diagnostic packages exported from the platform contain:

- Anomaly summary reports (PDF)
- Workpaper indices (JSON)
- Integrity manifests (SHA-256 checksums)

These exports are diagnostic aids only. They include a non-dismissible disclaimer stating that they do not constitute audit documentation under ISA 230 or PCAOB AS 1215. The practitioner is responsible for maintaining adequate audit documentation in their own working paper system.
