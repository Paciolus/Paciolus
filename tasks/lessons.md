## Lessons

### 2026-02-01 — Audit Infrastructure First
**Trigger:** Project audit scored 2.9/5 due to missing workflow artifacts (todo.md, lessons.md, git history).
**Pattern:** Before diving into features, establish the tracking infrastructure. Good code without documentation is hard to maintain.
**Example:** Day 7 directive prioritized workflow setup over new features.
