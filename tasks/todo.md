# Paciolus Development Roadmap

> **Protocol:** Every directive MUST begin with a Plan Update to this file and end with a Lesson Learned in `lessons.md`.

> **CEO actions:** All pending items requiring your direct action are tracked in [`tasks/ceo-actions.md`](ceo-actions.md). Engineering adds to it automatically at the end of each sprint.

---

## Phase Lifecycle Protocol

**MANDATORY:** Follow this lifecycle for every phase. This eliminates manual archive requests.

### During a Phase
- Active phase details (audit findings, sprint checklists, reviews) live in this file under `## Active Phase`
- Each sprint gets a checklist section with tasks, status, and review

### On Phase Completion (Wrap Sprint)
1. **Regression:** `pytest` + `npm run build` + `npm test` must pass
2. **Archive:** Move all sprint checklists/reviews to `tasks/archive/phase-<name>-details.md`
3. **Summarize:** Add a one-line summary to `## Completed Phases` below (with test count if changed)
4. **Clean this file:** Delete the entire `## Active Phase` section content, leaving only the header ready for the next phase
5. **Update CLAUDE.md:** Add phase to completed list, update test count + current phase
6. **Update MEMORY.md:** Update project status
7. **Commit:** `Sprint X: Phase Y wrap — regression verified, documentation archived`

**The `## Active Phase` section should ONLY contain the current in-progress phase. Once complete, it becomes empty until the next phase begins.**

**Archival threshold:** If the Active Phase accumulates 5+ completed sprints without a named phase wrap, archive them immediately as a standalone batch to `tasks/archive/`. Do not wait for a phase boundary.
