# Paciolus Development Roadmap

> **Protocol:** Every directive MUST begin with a Plan Update to this file and end with a Lesson Learned in `lessons.md`.

> **CEO actions:** All pending items requiring your direct action are tracked in [`tasks/ceo-actions.md`](ceo-actions.md). Engineering adds to it automatically at the end of each sprint.

---

## Phase Lifecycle Protocol

**MANDATORY:** Follow this lifecycle for every phase. This eliminates manual archive requests.

### During a Phase
- Active phase details (audit findings, sprint checklists, reviews) live in this file under `## Active Phase`
- Each sprint gets a checklist section with tasks, status, and review

### On Phase Completion (Wrap Sprint)
1. **Regression:** `pytest` + `npm run build` + `npm test` must pass
2. **Archive:** Move all sprint checklists/reviews to `tasks/archive/phase-<name>-details.md`
3. **Summarize:** Add a one-line summary to `## Completed Phases` below (with test count if changed)
4. **Clean this file:** Delete the entire `## Active Phase` section content, leaving only the header ready for the next phase
5. **Update CLAUDE.md:** Add phase to completed list, update test count + current phase
6. **Update MEMORY.md:** Update project status
7. **Commit:** `Sprint X: Phase Y wrap — regression verified, documentation archived`

**The `## Active Phase` section should ONLY contain the current in-progress phase. Once complete, it becomes empty until the next phase begins.**

**Archival threshold:** If the Active Phase accumulates 5+ completed sprints without a named phase wrap, archive them immediately as a standalone batch to `tasks/archive/`. Do not wait for a phase boundary.

### Sprint 519 — Structural Debt Remediation (Code Quality)

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (Phases 1–4 COMPLETE, Phase 5 plan below)
**Goal:** Reduce structural debt and consolidation drift across 5 phases without changing observable behavior.

#### Phase 1 — Quick Wins ✓
- [x] 1A: Frontend upload transport consolidation (`uploadTransport.ts`) — 4 files deduped
- [x] 1B: API client mutation cache invalidation dedup (`invalidateRelatedCaches`)
- [x] 1C: Backend billing endpoint boilerplate (`stripe_endpoint_guard`) — 5 endpoints
- [x] 1D: Backend audit route execution scaffold (`execute_file_tool`) — 4 endpoints
- [x] Tests pass after Phase 1

#### Phase 2 — Hook Decomposition ✓
- [x] Extract `useTrialBalanceUpload`, `useTrialBalancePreflight`, `useTrialBalanceExports`, `useTrialBalanceBenchmarks`
- [x] `useTrialBalanceAudit` reduced from 680→110 LOC (thin composite)
- [x] Tests pass after Phase 2

#### Phase 3 — Backend Engine Unification ✓
- [x] Create `engine_framework.py` with `AuditEngineBase` (10-step pipeline)
- [x] `JETestingEngine`, `APTestingEngine`, `PayrollTestingEngine` extend base
- [x] All 6,215 backend tests pass (3 pre-existing failures unrelated)

#### Phase 4 — Settings Page Decomposition ✓
- [x] Extract `MaterialitySection`, `ExportPreferencesSection`, `testingConfigFields`
- [x] Page reduced from 635→415 LOC
- [x] Build + tests pass after Phase 4

#### Phase 5 — Route/Service Boundary (Plan Only)
- [x] Plan output below — awaiting CEO approval before execution

##### Phase 5 Plan: billing.py Service Extraction

**Current state:** 651 LOC, 11 endpoints. Stripe API is already fully isolated in `billing/` submodule (0 direct Stripe calls in routes). `stripe_endpoint_guard` context manager reduces boilerplate. Service layer is well-organized.

**Proposed extraction:**
1. **CheckoutOrchestrator** (`billing/checkout_orchestrator.py`): Move 50+ lines of business logic from `create_checkout()` endpoint — trial eligibility, tier/seat validation, DPA acceptance, promo code resolution. Route keeps only HTTP concerns.
2. **UsageService** (`billing/usage_service.py`): Move 20+ lines from `get_usage()` — entitlement calculation, period tracking, activity log counting. Currently buried in route layer.
3. **SeatValidator** (add to `billing/subscription_manager.py`): Consolidate seat validation rules (solo plan can't have seats, max self-serve seats) from scattered endpoint logic.

**Expected outcome:** billing.py drops to ~500 LOC. Business rules become unit-testable without FastAPI context.
**Risk:** Low — Stripe calls already delegated, this is pure orchestration movement.

##### Phase 5 Plan: audit.py Service Extraction

**Current state:** 666 LOC, 8 endpoints. `execute_file_tool()` scaffold handles 4/8 endpoints. Two complex endpoints dominate: `audit_trial_balance` (128 lines) and `flux_analysis` (103 lines).

**Proposed extraction:**
1. **TrialBalancePostProcessor** (`shared/tb_post_processor.py`): Extract 50 lines of post-processing from `audit_trial_balance` — lead sheet grouping, section density computation, currency conversion. These are pure data transforms, not HTTP concerns.
2. **FluxOrchestrator** (`flux_orchestrator.py` or extend `flux_engine.py`): Extract 50 lines of dual-file StreamingAuditor sequencing + engine composition from `flux_analysis`.
3. **MaterialityResolver** (already exists as `_resolve_materiality` helper): Promote to shared utility — used by 3+ endpoints.

**Expected outcome:** audit.py drops to ~480 LOC. Post-processing and orchestration become independently testable.
**Risk:** Medium — `audit_trial_balance` has tight coupling between parsing, materiality resolution, and post-processing. Requires careful interface design.

### Sprint 517 — Memo Generator Test Coverage (DEC F-018)

**Status:** READY
**Goal:** Add dedicated test files for the 5 memo generators that lack deep coverage.
**Context:** DEC 2026-03-08 finding F-018. 13 other memo generators have dedicated tests; these 5 were enriched in Sprints 489–500 but tests were not expanded. `engagement_dashboard_memo.py` has zero test coverage.

- [ ] `tests/test_ap_testing_memo.py` — section headers, risk scoring, suggested procedures (5+ tests)
- [ ] `tests/test_je_testing_memo.py` — section headers, Benford analysis rendering, risk scoring (5+ tests)
- [ ] `tests/test_payroll_testing_memo.py` — section headers, enriched sections from Sprint 500 (5+ tests)
- [ ] `tests/test_preflight_memo.py` — section headers, data quality rendering (5+ tests)
- [ ] `tests/test_engagement_dashboard_memo.py` — PDF generation, cover page metadata, section headers (5+ tests)
- [ ] `pytest` passes for all new test files
- [ ] Pattern: follow `test_bank_rec_memo.py` or `test_sampling_memo.py` structure

---

### Sprint 518 — OpenAPI→TypeScript Drift Detection (DEC F-020)

**Status:** READY
**Goal:** Add a CI job that detects schema drift between backend OpenAPI spec and frontend TypeScript types.
**Context:** DEC 2026-03-08 finding F-020 (P3, systemic). 34 commits changed backend schemas and frontend types independently with no automated sync verification.

- [ ] Add CI job that generates OpenAPI spec from FastAPI (`/openapi.json`)
- [ ] Compare key response schemas against frontend `types/` definitions
- [ ] Fail CI on drift (or warn-only initially)
- [ ] Document the sync workflow in CLAUDE.md or a README
- [ ] Verify CI pipeline passes
