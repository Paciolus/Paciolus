### Sprint 598: Middleware Fail-Secure Hardening + Dep Hygiene
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Goal:** Close two latent middleware fail-open handlers uncovered by the weekly nightly review, tighten dev-dep floors

**Problem:** Weekly weakness hunt (2026-04-14) flagged two `except Exception: pass` sites in `security_middleware.py`:
- `RateLimitIdentityMiddleware` (line 263) — any non-JWT exception (e.g., config import failure, non-int `sub` claim, unicode decode error) silently downgrades the request to the anonymous rate-limit tier with no log and no metric. Rate-limit tier bypass was invisible.
- `ImpersonationMiddleware` (line 876) — any non-JWT exception on the pre-dispatch impersonation check was swallowed, bypassing the read-only gate. Downstream `require_current_user` still gates auth, but the defence-in-depth layer is lost when unexpected errors occur.

Both are narrow defence-in-depth issues, not exploitable in the tested happy-path (hence 0/0 test failures), but the fail-open semantics violated the stated intent of both middlewares.

**Changes:**
- [x] `security_middleware.py` — narrow `RateLimitIdentityMiddleware` except to `jwt.PyJWTError`, log non-JWT payload-shape failures (`TypeError`/`ValueError`) at `warning`, preserve anonymous fallthrough for genuine decode errors
- [x] `security_middleware.py` — narrow `ImpersonationMiddleware` except to `jwt.PyJWTError`, restructure so decode failure returns early to downstream auth dependency; unexpected exception types now surface instead of being swallowed
- [x] `backend/tests/test_rate_limit_tiered.py` — added 2 new tests: non-int `sub` triggers a warning log, malformed JWT stays silent (expected-failure path)
- [x] `backend/tests/test_impersonation_middleware.py` (new, 9 tests) — GET pass-through, POST without auth pass-through, valid non-imp token pass-through, `imp: true` blocked on POST/PUT/DELETE, expired imp still blocks, malformed JWT pass-through to downstream, non-Bearer auth pass-through
- [x] `backend/requirements.txt` — `python-multipart` 0.0.24 → 0.0.26 (patch), `sentry-sdk[fastapi]` 2.57.0 → 2.58.0 (minor), `prometheus_client` floor 0.22.0 → 0.25.0, `pypdf` floor 6.9.2 → 6.10.0
- [x] `backend/requirements-dev.txt` — `ruff` floor 0.15.8 → 0.15.10, `mypy` floor 1.19.0 → 1.20.1

**Review:**
- Backend: **7,403 passed, 19 xfailed** (+11 new: 9 impersonation + 2 rate-limit) in 649s — zero regressions
- Frontend: **1,757 passed** in 41s — zero regressions, `npm run build` clean, all 24 pages compile with dynamic CSP
- Scope deliberately narrow: bare `except Exception: pass` was the root cause, fix is to narrow the catch to the expected exception class. Unexpected exception types now bubble up as 500s, which is fail-closed.
- Refresh-token race condition in `auth.py:731-764` (also flagged by the weekly hunt) was left intact — the fail-secure behavior is deliberate and documented. Revisit only if multi-tab UX complaints appear.
- Deferred to future sprint: billing/checkout orchestrator bare-except review (needs deeper saga-compensation analysis), accrual_completeness float-site audit (needs domain-model review), CSRF-exempt `/auth/forgot-password` re-evaluation for authenticated-session case (low risk).

### Sprint 597: DOCX File Format Support
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Goal:** Add Word document (.docx) as an 11th supported file format for trial balance uploads

**Changes:**
- [x] `python-docx>=1.1.0` added to `backend/requirements.txt`
- [x] `FileFormat.DOCX` enum + `FormatProfile` in `shared/file_formats.py`
- [x] ZIP disambiguation: `_is_docx_zip()` checks for `word/` directory
- [x] `shared/docx_parser.py` — extracts tables from DOCX via python-docx
- [x] Parser dispatch in `shared/helpers.py` (`_parse_docx` wrapper + magic byte validation)
- [x] `FORMAT_DOCX_ENABLED` feature flag in `config.py` (default: true)
- [x] Frontend: `.docx` extension, MIME type, label in `utils/fileFormats.ts`
- [x] Backend tests: `test_docx_parser.py` (29 tests — disambiguation, parsing, detection, profile)
- [x] Updated `test_file_formats.py` (11 extensions, 13 MIME types)
- [x] Updated `fileFormats.test.ts` (11 entries, 13 types, DOCX acceptance)
- [x] Tier gating: paid tiers only (same as PDF/OFX/IIF/QBO/ODS)

**Review:**
- 89 backend tests pass (test_docx_parser + test_file_formats), 27 ODS tests unaffected
- 27 frontend fileFormats tests pass
- `npm run build` clean — all pages compile
- DOCX parsing extracts first table with data rows; skips header-only tables
- ZIP disambiguation: ODS (mimetype/content.xml) > DOCX (word/) > XLSX (default)

### Sprint 596: UnverifiedCTA — Explicit Verification Prompt on All Tool Pages
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Goal:** Replace silent content gating with an explicit "Verify Your Email" card so unverified users understand why tool pages appear blank

**Problem:** 11 of 12 tool pages hid their entire UI behind `isAuthenticated && isVerified` with no explanation. Authenticated users who hadn't verified their email saw only the page title and a blank area below — no upload zone, no controls, no message. The `VerificationBanner` in the top shell existed but was a small dismissible bar, easily overlooked. Users assumed the app was broken.

**Changes:**
- [x] New `UnverifiedCTA` component (`frontend/src/components/shared/UnverifiedCTA.tsx`) — email icon, "Verify Your Email" heading, explanation text, pointer to the resend banner. Oat & Obsidian tokens, motion entrance animation. Parallel to `GuestCTA`.
- [x] Exported from `frontend/src/components/shared/index.ts`
- [x] Added `{isAuthenticated && !isVerified && (<UnverifiedCTA />)}` block to all 11 tool pages: trial-balance, ap-testing, ar-aging, bank-rec, fixed-assets, inventory-testing, journal-entry-testing, payroll-testing, revenue-testing, statistical-sampling, three-way-match
- [x] Multi-period page left untouched — already has its own inline "Verify Your Email" card (Pattern B)
- [x] `npm run build` passes — all 12 tool pages compile cleanly

**Review:**
- Consistent three-state UX across all tools: unauthenticated → GuestCTA, unverified → UnverifiedCTA, verified → full tool UI
- The `VerificationBanner` in `AuthenticatedShell` still renders above the CTA for redundancy (resend button lives there)
- No backend changes; purely frontend UX improvement
