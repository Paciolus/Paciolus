Audit Journal
This file is a append-only log of periodic project audits.
Each entry is generated by the Project Auditor (/audit) and scores the project
against the workflow principles framework.
Entries are ordered oldest-first. The most recent audit is at the bottom.
Do not manually edit prior entries. New entries are appended by the auditor.

## Audit — 2026-02-01 | 🟠 Needs Attention | Overall: 2.9/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 2.8   |
| Task Management         | 2/5   |
| Core Principles         | 4/5   |
| **Overall**             | **2.9** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 2/5
**Finding:** No `tasks/todo.md` exists. No evidence of written plans before implementation. The CLAUDE.md defines a "Conflict Loop" process but no plan artifacts demonstrate its use.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/todo.md` and document plans with checkable items before starting each directive.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 5 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, project-auditor). Each has a single purpose. The IntegratorLead protocol in CLAUDE.md shows clear intent to use them.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider adding invocation logs to track actual agent usage.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 1/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` does not exist. No evidence of captured learnings or corrections.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/lessons.md` immediately. After any correction or mistake, document the pattern.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 3/5
**Finding:** Test data generator created and run. Progress indicators added. However, no formal test suite exists and no evidence of end-to-end verification runs.
**Recommendation:** Add automated verification commands. Run after each major change.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 4/5
**Finding:** No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Code is clean with clear separation. StreamingAuditor class well-architected. No over-engineering.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 3/5
**Finding:** No git history to evaluate. No failing tests visible. Code appears functional but untested in production.
**Recommendation:** Initialize git repository and commit changes to enable tracking.

### B. Task Management — 2/5
**Finding:** `tasks/todo.md` does not exist. No checkable items, progress tracking, or review sections. Directive→implementation flow exists in conversation but not documented.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/` directory with `todo.md`. Document plans before coding, track progress, add reviews.

### C. Core Principles — 4/5
**Finding:** Changes are surgical and focused. No dead code, temp fixes, or commented-out blocks. Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-storage policy well-enforced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Create `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` immediately.** The code quality is solid (4/5 on Core Principles), but the workflow infrastructure is missing. Without task tracking artifacts, learnings are lost between sessions and verification is ad-hoc.

### Trend Note
First audit — no prior baseline.

## Audit — 2026-02-04 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 4.7/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.5   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.7** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Excellent plan artifacts. `tasks/todo.md` contains 24 sprints with detailed plans before implementation. Each sprint includes affirmations, constraints, agent assignments, and checkable items. Plans are written before coding (see Sprint 24 checklist created before Dockerfiles). Evidence of re-planning: Sprint 18's "Diagnostic Fidelity" renamed terminology project-wide.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The sprint-based planning with agent assignments is exemplary.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 6 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor). Each has single purpose. Clear evidence of usage: todo.md assigns agents per task (e.g., "BackendCritic: Containerization"). Designer agent created marketing components in Sprint 23.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider logging agent invocations for metrics.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` is comprehensive with 20+ documented lessons spanning Sprints 8-24. Lessons follow the prescribed format with Trigger/Pattern/Example structure. Real corrections captured: "datetime.utcnow() is Deprecated", "framer-motion Type Assertions (Recurring)", "Multi-Stage Docker Builds". Evidence lessons are reviewed: recurring patterns noted across sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The lesson documentation is thorough.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 4/5
**Finding:** Frontend build verification performed (`npm run build`) after major changes. Test suite exists in `backend/tests/`. Review sections added to each sprint in todo.md with "Zero-Storage Verified" checkpoints. However, no evidence of automated CI/CD runs or test execution in recent sprints.
**Recommendation:** Consider adding automated test execution to sprint completion checklist.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code is clean with professional architecture. No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Clear separation of concerns (audit_engine, ratio_engine, flux_engine, recon_engine). Zero-Storage architecture consistently enforced. Multi-stage Docker builds demonstrate production-grade thinking. No over-engineering—components are appropriately sized.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 4/5
**Finding:** Sprint 23 autonomously identified and fixed two type errors (Industry type mismatch, framer-motion type assertion) discovered during build. Fixes documented in lessons.md and todo.md Review section. Limited git history (only 3 commits visible) restricts full evaluation.
**Recommendation:** Commit more frequently to enable better tracking. Consider atomic commits per feature.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** Exemplary task management. All 6 sub-practices present:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint has checkable items before implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Affirmations and constraints documented per sprint
3. **Track Progress** — Items marked complete incrementally (visible checkboxes)
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections explain architectural decisions
5. **Document Results** — Review sections with "Files Created/Modified" lists
6. **Capture Lessons** — lessons.md updated after each sprint

Quick Reference table tracks all 24 sprints. Evidence of cadence matching implementation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. This is the gold standard for task tracking.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Changes are surgical. Sprint 24's Dockerfile is minimal (slim images, no bloat).
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed. Sprint 23 fixed type errors at source, not with workarounds.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes only touch necessary files. Clear file lists in Review sections show focused changes.

Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-Storage architecture enforced at every layer (documented in DEPLOYMENT.md). IP documentation in dev-log.md demonstrates professional-grade due diligence.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Increase commit frequency.** With only 3 commits in git history for 24 sprints of work, the git log doesn't reflect the actual development cadence. Consider atomic commits after each sprint completion to build a proper history trail.

### Trend Note
**Dramatic improvement from prior audit:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 2.8 → 4.5 (+1.7)
- Task Management: 2/5 → 5/5 (+3)
- Core Principles: 4/5 → 5/5 (+1)
- Overall: 2.9 → 4.7 (+1.8)

All gaps identified in the first audit have been addressed:
- ✅ `tasks/todo.md` created and extensively used (was missing)
- ✅ `tasks/lessons.md` created with 20+ documented patterns (was missing)
- ✅ Git repository initialized with commits (was missing)
- ✅ Review sections added to every sprint (was missing)
- ✅ Verification checkpoints documented (was ad-hoc)
