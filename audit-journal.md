## Audit — 2026-02-23 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** The period since last audit spans Sprints 411-438 across multiple phases — lint remediation (411-420), multi-format file handling (421-438), and Phase LVIII (432-438). Every sprint in `tasks/todo.md` has detailed objectives, work done checklists, and review sections written before implementation. Sprint 421 demonstrates excellent multi-sprint decomposition with Sprint A (backend foundation), Sprint B (backend refactor), and Sprint C (frontend centralization) subsections. Phase LVIII's 7-sprint plan (432-438) maps ODS parser → malformed fixtures → resource guards → Prometheus metrics → tier-gated rollout → alert thresholds → integration testing in logical dependency order. Sprint 411 established lint baselines with a 4-bucket analysis (auto-fixable/accessibility/semantic/config) before remediation began — a textbook plan-before-execute pattern. Complexity scores assigned where applicable (Sprint 421: 4/10, Sprint 422: 5/10, Sprint 426: 5/10, Sprints 427-431: 6/10, Phase LVIII: 7/10).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 well-defined agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent). All remain single-purpose with clear role boundaries. The project-auditor agent is actively invoked (this audit). The future-state-consultant-agent (38KB) is the most substantial agent, indicating serious strategic planning capability. No evidence of bloated or unused agents.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` is 416 lines with 65+ lessons organized into 7 sections. Three new lessons were captured during this cycle from real corrections: (1) Sprint 414b — `initialValues` memoization to prevent infinite re-render loops (documented the full root cause chain: new object → unstable reset → useEffect re-fire → state update → loop), (2) Sprint 415 — modal backdrops should use `role="presentation"` not `role="button"` (correcting Sprint 412c's semantically incorrect fix), (3) Sprint 420 — redundant sr-only inputs with custom ARIA checkboxes (the hidden native input must be removed when upgrading to ARIA attributes). All three demonstrate the prescribed pattern: correction discovered → root cause understood → lesson documented with prevention rule. The Sprint 415 lesson explicitly references Sprint 412c's mistake and explains why `tabIndex={-1}` contradicts button role — showing self-correction across sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Every sprint has explicit verification documented. Sprint 420 includes a comprehensive baseline comparison table (Sprint 411 → Sprint 420) showing 687→0 total lint issues, 4,260→4,294 backend tests, 1,108→1,163 frontend tests, and 3→0 frontend test failures. Sprint 421 ran 7 verification commands (pytest on 2 test files, full pytest, ruff check, npm run build, eslint, frontend tests). Sprint 425 ran `pytest` full suite (4,464 passed). Phase LVIII Sprint 438 confirmed "All 185 new tests passing." Git log shows 20 atomic commits with descriptive messages following the `Sprint X: Description` convention. Recent commits span Sprints 412-438, each self-contained with clear scope.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in `backend/shared/` and `frontend/src/` (confirmed via grep). Recently created modules demonstrate professional quality: `ods_parser.py` uses a frozen dataclass (`OdsMetadata`), clean ZIP disambiguation (`_is_ods_zip()`), and docstrings with security notes. `alert_checker.py` uses Python 3.11 `tomllib` with `tomli` fallback — clean compat pattern without over-engineering. `fileFormats.ts` is a model single-source-of-truth module: `as const` arrays, clear JSDoc, extension+MIME validation with fallback. Sprint 416 (column detector convergence) chose the adapter pattern — wrapping legacy API over shared implementation rather than rewriting all 5 consumer engines — the right tradeoff of elegance vs blast radius. Sprint 417 (API client safety) applied RFC 9110 idempotency semantics correctly, with LRU eviction bounded at MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES=100 and dev-mode console.warn for unsafe mutation retries — no over-engineering. No hacky workarounds or duplicated logic detected.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Multiple autonomous bug fixes in this cycle: Sprint 414b diagnosed and fixed an infinite re-render loop (root cause: unstable `initialValues` object creating unstable `reset` callback in useEffect deps). Sprint 414c fixed a hydration mismatch on homepage auth-dependent UI. Sprint 420 fixed 3 pre-existing test failures (duplicate checkbox roles from Sprint 412c's accessibility work). Sprint 433 fixed PDF parser corrupt file handling (`pdfplumber.PdfminerException` catch was missing). All fixes were self-contained with root cause analysis documented. No incomplete fixes or back-and-forth patches in the git log. The Sprint 414b fix in particular demonstrates deep understanding of React's referential equality model — the lesson was captured in both `lessons.md` and committed with its own sprint number.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained at the highest level:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint (411-438) has objectives and checkable items written before implementation. Sprint 421 has 3 sub-sprint plans (A/B/C). Phase LVIII has 7 sub-sprint plans.
2. **Verify Plan** — Sprint 411 established lint baselines with bucket analysis before remediation. Sprint 421 planned backend→frontend migration order. Sprint 436 planned feature flag + tier-gating before implementation.
3. **Track Progress** — All sprints marked COMPLETE with work done checklists. Lint baseline comparison tables (Sprint 411→412→413→414→420) show incremental progress tracking.
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections document modified files, new tests, risk assessment, and complexity scores. Sprint 420 includes a shim removal table and deferred items list.
5. **Document Results** — Sprint 422 documents 22 modified files with test delta. Phase LVIII documents 22 new files, 15 modified files, 128 new tests, and 2 new dependencies.
6. **Capture Lessons** — 3 new lessons from Sprints 414b, 415, and 420 added to `lessons.md`.

Git log shows 20 atomic commits (Sprints 412-438) with descriptive messages. The `tasks/todo.md` Active Phase section contains 28 detailed sprint checklists spanning 1,035 lines — comprehensive but well-organized.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Sprint 411's lint baseline uses a simple 4-bucket categorization (auto-fixable/accessibility/semantic/config) — no over-engineered scoring system. The file format abstraction (`FormatProfile` frozen dataclass + enum dispatch) is appropriately scoped for 10 format variants — no factory pattern or plugin system where a simple dict + if/else suffices. Sprint 435's Prometheus metrics use a dedicated `CollectorRegistry` (4 metrics) — minimal surface area, no metrics framework.
- **No Laziness:** The lint remediation was thorough: ALL 687 issues fixed to zero (131 ruff + 55 eslint errors + 501 eslint warnings), not just the easy auto-fixable ones. Sprint 412c fixed all 51 accessibility errors with correct ARIA patterns. Sprint 420 removed 5 shims (migration artifacts) rather than leaving them. Sprint 433 created 18 malformed fixture tests across 7 formats — covering corrupt input for every supported format, not just the new ones.
- **Minimal Impact:** Each sprint's changes are precisely scoped. Sprint 416 touches 1 modified file + 1 new test file. Sprint 417 touches 3 modified files + 1 modified test file. Sprint 432-438 introduces new files without modifying existing parser paths — existing CSV/Excel/TSV/TXT/OFX/QBO/IIF behavior unchanged.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in the entire codebase. Oat & Obsidian design tokens remain consistent.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Archive the Active Phase and determine next phase scope.** The Active Phase section in `tasks/todo.md` contains 28 sprint checklists (Sprints 411-438) spanning 1,035 lines — these should be archived to `tasks/archive/` per the Phase Lifecycle Protocol. Phase LVIII (ODS + cross-format hardening) appears complete and should be wrapped with regression verification, archival, and CLAUDE.md update. The deferred items list includes pandas 3.0 evaluation, React 19 upgrade, and cookie-based auth migration — convene the Agent Council to evaluate next priorities.

### Trend Note

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.7   |
| Task Management         | 4/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.6** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase LIX (Hybrid Pricing Model Overhaul) exhibits the strongest planning discipline in project history for a pricing change. A dedicated decision record exists at tasks/decisions/pricing-model-overhaul.md. The 6-sprint decomposition (A: display-name layer, B: seat model, C: trial infrastructure, D: pricing page, E: checkout flow, F: integration testing) reflects correct dependency ordering. The Report Standardization track (Sprints 0-8) shows an independent, well-sequenced 8-sprint plan: metadata foundation, cover page, scope/methodology, text layout, typography, source document transparency, signoff deprecation, QA automation. The Billing Launch Configuration Sprint has a concrete 8-item checklist that is implementation-specific and deterministic. No evidence of mid-sprint pivots or unplanned scope additions.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ remain single-purpose and well-scoped: critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. The project-auditor agent is actively invoked (this audit). Agent boundary discipline is maintained -- no agent has accreted responsibilities outside its stated role.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** tasks/lessons.md opens with 4 new lessons from Phase LIX: (1) Sprint A -- test fixture defaults cascade through the entire suite, documented with full impact and fix strategy; (2) Sprint A -- display-name layer prevents DB enum lock-in, an architectural insight elevated to a reusable pattern; (3) Sprint B -- SQLAlchemy Column(default=) does not apply on bare instantiation, a precise technical finding with two concrete remediation options; (4) Sprint F -- Prometheus counter _total suffix stripping in collect(), a naming convention nuance that would recur without the lesson. All four follow the correction, root cause, prevention rule structure. The Sprint F lesson was the final sprint of the phase, confirming lessons are captured at time of discovery rather than retrospectively.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 3/5
**Finding:** Two related failures are present simultaneously and constitute the material finding of this audit cycle.

First: Billing Launch Sprint -- explicit unchecked verification. The Billing Launch Configuration Sprint in tasks/todo.md shows 7/8 items checked, with item 8 (Verification: pytest billing tests + npm run build) explicitly unchecked. The sprint is marked In Progress. This is unambiguous documentation that the verification step was not performed before the sprint was left in its current state. The Post-Sprint Checklist in tasks/todo.md designates this step MANDATORY.

Second: 122 uncommitted files -- Post-Sprint Checklist final commit step skipped across all completed work. Phase LIX (6 sprints, all marked COMPLETE), Tier ID Rename (marked COMPLETE), Report Standardization Sprints 0-8 (marked COMPLETE), and the Billing Launch Sprint all exist only in the working tree. The most recent git commit is 29a2fa9 per the evidence, yet 122 files remain modified or untracked. The mandatory commit step was not executed for any completed sprint in this cycle.
**Recommendation:** Before beginning any new work: (1) run pytest and npm run build to close the Billing Launch Sprint verification gap and check off item 8; (2) commit all 122 files in appropriately scoped atomic commits following the Sprint X: Description convention. Going forward, treat the git commit as a hard gate -- a sprint cannot be marked COMPLETE in todo.md until the commit sha is recorded. Consider adding the commit sha to each sprint Review section as evidence of completion.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments confirmed across all backend Python and frontend TypeScript files. The display-name layer architecture (tier_display.py as a thin mapping over immutable PostgreSQL enums) is the correct solution to a genuinely constrained problem -- branding change without DB migration risk. The _load_stripe_price_ids() lazy-loader pattern in price_config.py avoids circular imports while deferring environment reads to first use. The backward-compat alias in rate_limits.py reflects the correct tradeoff between clean naming and migration safety. Frozen data structures (frozenset, frozen dataclasses) are used where mutation would be a defect. No over-engineering detected for the complexity of the billing domain changes.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Three documented autonomous bug-fix episodes in this cycle. Sprint A identified and resolved a fixture-default cascade where changing UserTier.PROFESSIONAL entitlements would have silently broken ~30 test files -- the fix required auditing all make_user call sites and updating the conftest default to UserTier.TEAM. Sprint B resolved the SQLAlchemy Column(default=1) bare-instantiation gap before it created flaky test failures. Sprint F caught and corrected the Prometheus _total naming convention mismatch in counter assertions. All three were self-identified (not user-reported), self-contained, and documented in lessons.md with prevention rules. No back-and-forth patches or incomplete fixes in evidence.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 4/5
**Finding:** Five of the six Post-Sprint Checklist sub-practices are consistently applied. Plan First: all sprints have written objectives and checkable items before implementation. Verify Plan: sprint decomposition order reflects dependency analysis (display-name layer before seat model before trial infrastructure is correct sequencing). Track Progress: completed items are individually checked; the Billing Launch Sprint item 8 is correctly left unchecked because the work was not done -- the tracking system is functioning as intended, the workflow is not. Explain Changes: sprint reviews are documented with key decisions. Capture Lessons: 4 new lessons from Phase LIX, actively maintained.

The single gap: the final Post-Sprint Checklist step -- git commit -- was not executed for any sprint completed in this cycle. The Phase Lifecycle Protocol in tasks/todo.md explicitly lists commit as a mandatory wrap step. The 122 uncommitted files represent 6+ sprint cycles of completed work that exists only in the working tree, not in git history. This breaks the auditability of the completion record.
**Recommendation:** Execute the git commits immediately. Enforce the commit step as a prerequisite for marking a sprint COMPLETE -- the checkbox in todo.md must not be set until the commit sha is recorded.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:** Simplicity First -- the display-name layer approach to tier renaming is the simplest solution consistent with PostgreSQL enum constraints: one new file (tier_display.py), one backward-compat alias, zero migration complexity. validate_billing_config() performs environment variable presence checks, not schema validation -- correctly scoped. No Laziness -- the Tier ID Rename was comprehensive: 10 backend test files, 3 frontend test files, 7 backend modules, 5 frontend components/pages, with grep verification confirming zero stale references outside migrations and compat alias. Report Standardization applied source document transparency across the entire PDF memo generator fleet in Sprint 6, not selectively. Minimal Impact -- the display-name layer adds a new file rather than modifying the ORM enum; existing database rows, Stripe metadata, and all downstream consumers are untouched. Sprint scope boundaries respected throughout. Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat and Obsidian design tokens consistent. No dead code introduced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
Commit all 122 uncommitted files in appropriately scoped atomic commits before beginning any new work. The sequence is: (1) run pytest billing tests and npm run build to close the Billing Launch Sprint unchecked verification item; (2) check off item 8 in tasks/todo.md; (3) commit all 122 files across 3-4 appropriately scoped commits (Report Standardization Sprints 0-8, Phase LIX + Tier Rename, Billing Launch Configuration); (4) archive Phase LIX from the Active Phase section per the Phase Lifecycle Protocol. Then convene the Agent Council to determine the next phase scope.

### Trend Note
First score regression in 14 audits. Prior entry (2026-02-23): 5.0/5.0 overall.
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 -> 4.7 (regressed -- A4 dropped from 5 to 3)
- Task Management: 5/5 -> 4/5 (regressed -- Post-Sprint Checklist commit step skipped)
- Core Principles: 5/5 -> 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 -> 4.6 (regressed)

This is the 15th audit. The project remains in the Excellent band (4.6 >= 4.5), but this is the first regression since the audit journal was established. The regression is attributable to a single root cause: the mandatory git commit step in the Post-Sprint Checklist was not executed for any sprint completed in this cycle, and the Billing Launch Sprint verification step was left unchecked while the sprint remains In Progress. Code quality, planning discipline, lessons capture, and autonomous problem-solving remain at peak. The regression is workflow-procedural, not architectural or substantive. It is recoverable in one session.

## Audit — 2026-02-27 | 🟡 Good — minor gaps | Overall: 4.2/5.0

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.7   |
| Task Management         | 4/5   |
| Core Principles         | 4/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.2** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 4/5
**Finding:** Sprint 447 (Stripe Production Cutover) has a well-structured 8-item checklist with correct dependency ordering (Dashboard configuration before cutover before smoke test). Sprint 445 is marked COMPLETE with verification noted. The planning failure is specific: the Deferred Items table in tasks/todo.md explicitly listed pandas 3.0 upgrade as requiring a dedicated evaluation sprint before adoption. Commit 4f512aa merged the dependabot PR for pandas-3.0.1 without a preceding plan entry, without a dedicated evaluation commit, and without updating the deferred items table. By contrast, the Tailwind v4 migration (also a dependabot bump) was followed by an explicit migration commit (5a34352 Migrate Tailwind CSS v3 to v4) addressing breaking changes — the correct pattern. The pandas upgrade has no equivalent remediation commit. Tests pass at 5,557, but CoW semantics and string dtype changes were explicitly called out as requiring evaluation beyond test passage.
**Recommendation:** Create a dedicated pandas 3.0 evaluation sprint entry in tasks/todo.md. Document which CoW-affected code paths were touched, confirm .copy() usage patterns are intentional, and verify string dtype behavior in the parsing engines. Update the Deferred Items table to reflect actual state — either marked closed with evaluation findings, or re-listed with specific open questions. A deferred item silently absorbed without closure is a tracking liability.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** The prior audit primary finding — 122 uncommitted files — was acted on completely: working tree is clean, all prior sprint work is committed. This is the canonical self-improvement loop: audit identifies gap, gap is closed before next cycle. tasks/lessons.md is documented at 1,000+ lines with extensive Phase LIX, LX, LXI, LXII lessons. No evidence of the same mistake recurring from a prior captured lesson. The pandas 3.0 bypass and Tailwind v4 token risk are current-cycle observations; their capture in lessons.md is a forward-looking expectation for this cycle close.
**Recommendation:** Capture a lesson from the pandas 3.0 dependabot merge pattern: when a dependency flagged as deferred-with-evaluation-requirement is merged via dependabot, the evaluation sprint must still be executed — a green test suite does not substitute for a breaking-change evaluation.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 4/5
**Finding:** The prior audit unchecked verification item (Billing Launch Sprint item 8) is no longer visible as an open item — Phase LX is marked COMPLETE in MEMORY.md and the Active Phase section no longer contains that sprint. This gap appears closed. Current verification posture is otherwise strong: 5,557 backend tests (1 skipped), ~1,190 frontend tests, working tree clean, Sprint 445 explicitly verified. The Tailwind v4 migration regression sequence (bump -> migration commit -> multiple visual fix commits) demonstrates active post-deployment verification. The remaining gap: pandas 3.0 was merged via dependabot and test passage was presumably the sole verification gate. The planned evaluation (Copy-on-Write semantics, string dtype changes, performance baselines) was not executed. This is a verification gap for a dependency flagged as requiring dedicated evaluation.
**Recommendation:** Execute the pandas 3.0 evaluation before Sprint 448 begins: (1) audit all .copy() and .assign() call sites in audit_engine.py, revenue_testing.py, payroll_testing.py, ar_aging.py, fixed_asset_testing.py for CoW compliance; (2) verify string dtype behavior in column detection is unchanged; (3) run a performance baseline on TB upload with a large fixture to confirm no regression. Document findings in the sprint review.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** The Tailwind v4 migration reflects the correct approach: dependabot handled the version bump, a dedicated commit (5a34352) addressed v3->v4 configuration breaking changes, and subsequent targeted commits corrected specific visual regressions (7ac87b9 Fix bottom clipping, f56f138 Oatmeal screen background, 7ae02d4 Compact hero panel). Each fix is scoped to the specific regression, not a broad rewrite. The company name toolbar addition (8bc789c) is a single-commit minimal-impact change. No TODO/FIXME/HACK commits visible in the git log. Recent commits show surgical precision — none touch unrelated areas.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** The Tailwind v4 migration generated visual regressions that were diagnosed and fixed autonomously across multiple commits: bc477ca Fix hero walkthrough animation stuck at opacity 0, 7ac87b9 Fix bottom clipping and replace grainy background with solid color, f56f138 Oatmeal screen background single-line subtitle light-on-dark layer colors, 7ae02d4 Compact hero panel reduce whitespace clear navbar overlap. Each fix has a specific descriptive commit message identifying the exact symptom. No back-and-forth with user direction required. No incomplete fixes left open. The pattern of bump -> migrate -> fix regressions is a complete autonomous resolution cycle.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 4/5
**Finding:** Five of six sub-practices are consistently applied. Plan First: Sprint 447 has a proper structured checklist. Track Progress: Sprint 445 marked COMPLETE with verification. Explain Changes: sprint reviews present. Capture Lessons: prior cycle lessons documented. The prior audit commit gap is closed — working tree is clean.

Two gaps remain. First: the Deferred Items table still lists pandas 3.0 upgrade as deferred, but commit 4f512aa already merged pandas-3.0.1 into the backend. The tracking document and the codebase are out of sync. A deferred item was bypassed without a corresponding closure or update in the tracking record. Second: commit SHAs are still not recorded in sprint Review sections. The prior audit recommended this as a hard gate — a sprint cannot be marked COMPLETE until the commit sha is recorded. No evidence this recommendation was implemented in the Active Phase structure.
**Recommendation:** (1) Update the Deferred Items table immediately: either document the pandas 3.0 evaluation findings and mark it closed, or re-list it as an active risk with specific open questions. (2) Add a Commit SHA field to the sprint Review section template in tasks/todo.md so every completed sprint has a verifiable record.

### C. Core Principles — 4/5
**Finding:** Simplicity First and No Laziness are well-maintained. The Tailwind v4 migration was executed with the correct migrate-config-then-fix-regressions discipline rather than a band-aid approach. Company name addition is the correct minimal change. Zero-Storage compliance is maintained — no new persistence patterns in recent commits. The Minimal Impact concern is specific to the Oat and Obsidian design mandate: Tailwind v4 moves from tailwind.config.js color extensions to CSS-first configuration, which changes how custom tokens (obsidian/oatmeal/clay/sage) are declared and inherited. Multiple visual regression commits after the migration (f56f138, 7ac87b9) indicate some token rendering was disrupted. A tailwind.config.js file appears in the changed files set, suggesting token definitions were addressed, but there is no explicit audit evidence that every Oat and Obsidian semantic token survived with full fidelity across all 100+ affected frontend components. The design mandate is STRICT and carries audit score penalties.
**Recommendation:** Perform an explicit Oat and Obsidian token audit post-Tailwind v4 migration. Grep for any hardcoded hex values or generic Tailwind color classes (slate-*, blue-*, green-*, red-*) introduced during the migration. Verify the theme block in globals.css defines all four core tokens and their scale variants. Document the verification result in a sprint review entry.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Execute the pandas 3.0 evaluation sprint.** The package is already in the codebase. The CoW semantics and string dtype changes that prompted the dedicated evaluation sprint requirement are present and unverified. Specifically: audit all .copy(), .assign(), and chained-indexing patterns in the five heaviest pandas consumers (audit_engine.py, revenue_testing.py, payroll_testing.py, ar_aging.py, fixed_asset_testing.py), run a performance baseline on TB upload with a 10,000-row fixture, document findings, update the Deferred Items table, and close the item. This is the only open verification gap that could surface a silent behavioral regression in production.

### Trend Note
Score regressed from prior audit (2026-02-25). This is the second regression in two consecutive audits.
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.7 -> 4.7 (flat — A1 and A4 both remain at 4, same structural category of gaps as prior cycle)
- Task Management: 4/5 -> 4/5 (flat — prior audit commit gap closed, but deferred-item tracking gap opened)
- Core Principles: 5/5 -> 4/5 (regressed — Tailwind v4 token fidelity uncertainty introduces a design mandate compliance risk)
- Overall: 4.6 -> 4.2 (regressed — dropped from Excellent band to Good band)

This is the 16th audit. The project has dropped from the Excellent band (>=4.5) to the Good band (4.2) for the first time. Two structural issues are driving the regression: (1) a deferred item (pandas 3.0) was absorbed into the codebase without executing the planned evaluation, creating a tracking inconsistency and an unverified behavioral risk; (2) the Tailwind v4 migration introduced uncertainty around Oat and Obsidian token fidelity that has not been formally verified. The prior cycle procedural regression (uncommitted files) was resolved completely and is not a factor here. The new regressions are substantive: one is a dependency governance gap, one is a design mandate compliance gap. Both are recoverable in one evaluation sprint.

### A1. Plan Mode Default -- 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 448 is the direct, complete execution of the evaluation sprint that the prior audit identified as missing. The scope was concrete before any code was written: CoW audit across affected call sites, dtype check, performance baseline on a 10,000-row fixture. The evaluation was executed exactly as planned. The prior A1 finding was pandas merged without a plan entry. That gap is now closed -- the plan entry was created, the evaluation was run, a real breaking change was caught and fixed, and the Deferred Items table was updated to RESOLVED with findings. This is plan-mode default operating correctly: deferred item flagged with evaluation requirement, dependabot bump occurred, dedicated sprint executed the evaluation that was always required, findings documented.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy -- 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop -- 5/5
**Finding:** The prior audit recommended capturing a lesson from the pandas/dependabot merge pattern -- specifically that a green test suite does not substitute for a breaking-change evaluation when a dependency was flagged as deferred-with-evaluation-requirement. Three new lessons were added to tasks/lessons.md this cycle: (1) pandas string dtype breaking change -- pd.StringDtype() vs object dtype guard bypass; (2) dependabot governance for deferred items -- the evaluation sprint must execute regardless of test passage; (3) safe CoW patterns verified list -- enumerate which patterns are confirmed safe for reference. The loop operated precisely as designed: audit flags gap, lesson is captured, lesson prevents recurrence. Three lessons from a single sprint indicates active capture discipline, not retrospective documentation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done -- 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 448 constitutes rigorous verification: (1) full CoW audit across all affected call sites -- df.copy(), iloc[].copy(), dict accumulators, column reassignment all confirmed safe; (2) dtype check that caught a real breaking change -- df[col].dtype == object guard bypassed by pandas 3.0 pd.StringDtype for CSV string columns, silently disabling the cell-length OOM protection; (3) performance baseline -- 10,000-row TB parse at 46ms avg across 3 trials; (4) 5,557 tests pass, 1 skipped -- identical count. One real production bug was caught and fixed. This is verification done correctly: not just test passage, but a structured evaluation across behavioral dimensions. The prior A4 finding was pandas evaluation not executed. That finding is fully resolved. Fix committed as 0cbc8ab in the same sprint, confirming verification and correction happened in a single atomic cycle.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.
### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) -- 5/5
**Finding:** The fix is a single-line replacement in shared/helpers.py:571 -- df[col].dtype == object replaced by pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(df[col]). This is the correct pandas-idiomatic API: it handles all string dtype variants (Python object, pd.StringDtype, ArrowDtype with string backing) without requiring enumeration of dtype variants. The OOM protection guard was preserved and made dtype-agnostic rather than bypassed. No over-engineering: one function call replaced one equality check. The change is in the correct shared utility location. No ancillary files were modified.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing -- 5/5
**Finding:** The dtype bug was identified autonomously during the evaluation pass -- not user-reported, not surfaced by tests. Root cause correctly diagnosed: pandas 3.0 changed the default dtype for string columns in CSV parsing from Python object to pd.StringDtype, which evaluates to false on the == object comparison, silently bypassing the cell-length OOM guard in shared/helpers.py. The fix was precise, targeted, and committed in the same sprint with a descriptive message (fix string dtype guard). No back-and-forth. No incomplete state. The bug would have been invisible in testing because the guard omission does not cause test failures -- it only manifests under adversarial inputs with very long cell values. Catching it during a planned evaluation rather than in production is the correct outcome.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management -- 4/5
**Finding:** Five of six sub-practices are now applied at the highest level. Plan First: Sprint 448 had concrete scope before execution. Track Progress: Deferred Items table updated to RESOLVED with findings -- the tracking gap from the prior audit is closed. Explain Changes: sprint review documents all three evaluation dimensions plus the specific bug and fix. Capture Lessons: 3 new lessons added. Document Results: completion notes in tasks/todo.md, Sprint 448 added to Completed Phases in CLAUDE.md.

One gap persists across two consecutive audits without implementation: commit SHAs are not recorded as a formal field in sprint Review sections. The prior audit explicitly recommended this as a hard gate -- a sprint cannot be marked COMPLETE until the commit SHA is recorded in the sprint Review section. Sprint 448 commit is 0cbc8ab; there is no evidence this SHA appears in the todo.md sprint Review entry. This recommendation has been raised in the 16th and 17th audits without implementation. It does not drop the score below 4 because all substantive sub-practices are strong, but a repeated unimplemented recommendation from a prior audit is a process discipline signal.
**Recommendation:** Add a Commit SHA field to the sprint Review section template in tasks/todo.md. Record 0cbc8ab for Sprint 448 as the first instance. This is a one-time template change and one-line entry -- the implementation cost is trivial and the recommendation has now been raised twice.

### C. Core Principles -- 5/5
**Finding:** Both prior C concerns are fully resolved. Tailwind v4 token audit: tailwind.config.js confirmed to define all four core tokens (obsidian, oatmeal, clay, sage) with full scale variants; 0 occurrences of generic color classes (slate-*, blue-*, green-*, red-*, gray-*) across all .tsx/.ts/.css source files -- the Oat and Obsidian design mandate is fully intact post-migration. Pandas evaluation: the process gap (deferred item absorbed without evaluation) is closed. Simplicity First: single-line dtype fix using the correct stdlib API. No Laziness: the full evaluation was executed -- CoW audit, dtype check, perf baseline -- not just test passage. Minimal Impact: the change touches exactly one function in one shared utility file; no other files were modified. Zero-Storage compliance maintained throughout.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.
### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Implement the Commit SHA field in the sprint Review section template.** This is the only remaining open process gap identified across the last two audits. The implementation cost is trivial: add one Commit SHA field to the standard Review section template in tasks/todo.md, record 0cbc8ab for Sprint 448, and enforce it as a completion gate going forward. Once implemented, all six Task Management sub-practices will be operating at the highest level and Pillar B will be eligible to return to 5/5. Sprint 447 (Stripe Production Cutover) remains correctly deferred pending external dependencies (CEO sign-off + live keys) -- no action required there.

### Trend Note
Strong recovery from two consecutive regression cycles.
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.7 -> 5.0 (recovered -- all six A pillars at 5/5; A1 and A4 both resolved by Sprint 448 execution)
- Task Management: 4/5 -> 4/5 (flat -- prior tracking gap closed, but commit SHA field recommendation unimplemented for second consecutive audit)
- Core Principles: 4/5 -> 5/5 (recovered -- both prior concerns resolved: pandas evaluation complete, Tailwind v4 token fidelity confirmed at 0 generic classes)
- Overall: 4.2 -> 4.7 (recovered -- returned to Excellent band from Good band)

This is the 17th audit. The project has returned to the Excellent band (4.7 >= 4.5) after one cycle in the Good band. The recovery is attributable to Sprint 448: a single well-scoped evaluation sprint that closed four open audit findings simultaneously (A1 plan gap, A4 verification gap, B tracking gap via Deferred Items update, C process gap via evaluation execution). The one remaining open item -- commit SHA as a formal sprint Review field -- is the sole structural gap preventing a return to 5.0 overall. It has now been raised in two consecutive audits. The self-improvement loop is demonstrably functioning: audit identifies gaps, gaps are closed in the next cycle, lessons are captured.

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default -- 5/5
**Finding:** No new sprints were initiated this cycle. Sprint 447 (Stripe Production Cutover) remains correctly PENDING, gated on external non-automatable dependencies (CEO sign-off + sk_live_ keys). The only work performed this session was a single-item template addition to the Post-Sprint Checklist (SHA field) and a one-line backfill of Sprint 448 review entry -- both the direct output of the 17th audit top priority recommendation. This is plan-mode default in its most lightweight form: a trivial change executed from a clear prior specification, no re-planning required.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy -- 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat detected. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep or role overlap.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop -- 5/5
**Finding:** The 17th audit raised the SHA field recommendation for the second consecutive time and flagged it as a repeated unimplemented recommendation -- a process discipline signal. That signal was acted on this session: item 7 of the Post-Sprint Checklist in tasks/todo.md now reads "Record commit SHA in sprint Review section (e.g., Commit: abc1234)", and Sprint 448 review entry was backfilled with "Commit: 0cbc8ab". The loop completed in one cycle after the second raising: audit flags persistence, implementation follows before next audit. Three Sprint 448 lessons remain on file in tasks/lessons.md (pandas string dtype, dependabot governance, CoW safe patterns). No lesson-covered mistake is visible in recent commits.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done -- 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 447 is correctly held at PENDING with all checklist items unchecked -- the sprint cannot proceed until external dependencies are satisfied. The SHA addition and Sprint 448 backfill are documentation-only changes with no build or test surface area; no verification gate applies. The last sprint with code changes (Sprint 448, commit 0cbc8ab) was verified at 5,557 tests passing, 1 skipped -- unchanged since prior audit. No incomplete verification state exists anywhere in the project.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) -- 5/5
**Finding:** The SHA field addition is a single-line markdown edit -- the minimum viable implementation of the recommendation. No over-engineering: the field is plain text (Commit: abc1234), not a structured schema or automated extraction system. The Sprint 448 backfill is one line appended to an existing review entry. These changes touch exactly what they need to touch and nothing else. Prior codebase quality posture (0 TODO/FIXME/HACK, single-line dtype fix, surgical Sprint 448 scope) is unchanged.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing -- 5/5
**Finding:** No bugs were introduced or present this cycle. The audit-journal.md unstaged state is expected and correct -- it is an audit artifact accumulating entries during the session, not sprint work, and the Post-Sprint Checklist does not govern it. No back-and-forth or incomplete fixes are visible. The prior Sprint 448 dtype fix (0cbc8ab) remains the most recent code change and was self-contained.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider committing audit-journal.md as a standalone commit after each audit session to preserve the record in git history.

### B. Task Management -- 5/5
**Finding:** All six sub-practices are now operating with structural implementation -- the first time Pillar B has scored 5/5 since its regression in the 15th audit cycle.
1. Plan First -- Sprint 447 has a complete structured checklist before any implementation begins.
2. Verify Plan -- Sprint 447 correctly held PENDING; external gate items are correctly unchecked pending CEO sign-off and live Stripe keys.
3. Track Progress -- Sprint 448 marked COMPLETE with backfilled SHA. Deferred Items table updated to RESOLVED with evaluation findings (prior cycle).
4. Explain Changes -- Sprint 448 review documents CoW audit scope, dtype finding and fix location, performance baseline, and test count.
5. Document Results -- Completion notes in tasks/todo.md and CLAUDE.md. SHA backfill closes the final documentation gap.
6. Capture Lessons -- Three new lessons from Sprint 448 on file. Prior audit recommendation acted on within one cycle.

The SHA field -- raised in the 16th and 17th audits without implementation -- now has structural enforcement: it is item 7 of the mandatory Post-Sprint Checklist, not an informal recommendation. Sprint 448 is the first sprint with a formally recorded SHA in the review section. No sub-practice gap remains.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Enforce the SHA field as a hard completion gate -- a sprint review entry without a SHA is structurally incomplete under the Post-Sprint Checklist.

### C. Core Principles -- 5/5
**Finding:** Simplicity First: the SHA field is a plain-text one-liner; the checklist template edit adds one bullet to an existing list without restructuring the format. No Laziness: the recommendation was implemented completely -- both template update and Sprint 448 backfill -- rather than partially. Minimal Impact: the only modified files are tasks/todo.md (template + Sprint 448 entry) and audit-journal.md (this audit). Zero-Storage compliance unchanged. Oat and Obsidian design mandate unchanged -- no frontend modifications this cycle. No dead code, no commented-out sections, no shortcuts introduced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Commit audit-journal.md to preserve the audit record.** The journal file is modified and unstaged -- it contains the 16th, 17th, and now 18th audit entries. These entries constitute the project workflow compliance record and should be committed as a standalone atomic commit (e.g., "Audit: append 16th-18th audit journal entries"). This is not sprint work and should be a separate commit from any future sprint activity. Once committed, the working tree returns to clean and the audit record is durable in git history. After that, Sprint 447 awaits only external inputs (CEO sign-off + sk_live_ keys) -- no automatable work remains.

### Trend Note
Full recovery to 5.0/5.0 -- the first perfect score since the 14th audit (2026-02-23).
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 -> 5.0 (maintained -- all six A pillars at 5/5 for second consecutive audit)
- Task Management: 4/5 -> 5/5 (recovered -- SHA field structurally implemented in Post-Sprint Checklist; Sprint 448 backfilled; all six sub-practices now operational)
- Core Principles: 5/5 -> 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 4.7 -> 5.0 (recovered -- returned to peak score)

This is the 18th audit. The project has returned to 5.0/5.0 for the first time since the 14th audit. The sole persistent gap across the 16th and 17th audits (commit SHA not recorded as a formal Post-Sprint Checklist item) is now fully resolved: structural implementation in the template, one-line backfill for Sprint 448, and the self-improvement loop completed its cycle. The audit-journal.md unstaged state is the only noteworthy item and is benign -- it is an expected artifact of the audit session. All three pillars are at their maximum. Sprint 447 correctly awaits external inputs. No automatable remediation work is open.
