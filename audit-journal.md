## Audit — 2026-02-23 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** The period since last audit spans Sprints 411-438 across multiple phases — lint remediation (411-420), multi-format file handling (421-438), and Phase LVIII (432-438). Every sprint in `tasks/todo.md` has detailed objectives, work done checklists, and review sections written before implementation. Sprint 421 demonstrates excellent multi-sprint decomposition with Sprint A (backend foundation), Sprint B (backend refactor), and Sprint C (frontend centralization) subsections. Phase LVIII's 7-sprint plan (432-438) maps ODS parser → malformed fixtures → resource guards → Prometheus metrics → tier-gated rollout → alert thresholds → integration testing in logical dependency order. Sprint 411 established lint baselines with a 4-bucket analysis (auto-fixable/accessibility/semantic/config) before remediation began — a textbook plan-before-execute pattern. Complexity scores assigned where applicable (Sprint 421: 4/10, Sprint 422: 5/10, Sprint 426: 5/10, Sprints 427-431: 6/10, Phase LVIII: 7/10).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 well-defined agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent). All remain single-purpose with clear role boundaries. The project-auditor agent is actively invoked (this audit). The future-state-consultant-agent (38KB) is the most substantial agent, indicating serious strategic planning capability. No evidence of bloated or unused agents.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` is 416 lines with 65+ lessons organized into 7 sections. Three new lessons were captured during this cycle from real corrections: (1) Sprint 414b — `initialValues` memoization to prevent infinite re-render loops (documented the full root cause chain: new object → unstable reset → useEffect re-fire → state update → loop), (2) Sprint 415 — modal backdrops should use `role="presentation"` not `role="button"` (correcting Sprint 412c's semantically incorrect fix), (3) Sprint 420 — redundant sr-only inputs with custom ARIA checkboxes (the hidden native input must be removed when upgrading to ARIA attributes). All three demonstrate the prescribed pattern: correction discovered → root cause understood → lesson documented with prevention rule. The Sprint 415 lesson explicitly references Sprint 412c's mistake and explains why `tabIndex={-1}` contradicts button role — showing self-correction across sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Every sprint has explicit verification documented. Sprint 420 includes a comprehensive baseline comparison table (Sprint 411 → Sprint 420) showing 687→0 total lint issues, 4,260→4,294 backend tests, 1,108→1,163 frontend tests, and 3→0 frontend test failures. Sprint 421 ran 7 verification commands (pytest on 2 test files, full pytest, ruff check, npm run build, eslint, frontend tests). Sprint 425 ran `pytest` full suite (4,464 passed). Phase LVIII Sprint 438 confirmed "All 185 new tests passing." Git log shows 20 atomic commits with descriptive messages following the `Sprint X: Description` convention. Recent commits span Sprints 412-438, each self-contained with clear scope.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in `backend/shared/` and `frontend/src/` (confirmed via grep). Recently created modules demonstrate professional quality: `ods_parser.py` uses a frozen dataclass (`OdsMetadata`), clean ZIP disambiguation (`_is_ods_zip()`), and docstrings with security notes. `alert_checker.py` uses Python 3.11 `tomllib` with `tomli` fallback — clean compat pattern without over-engineering. `fileFormats.ts` is a model single-source-of-truth module: `as const` arrays, clear JSDoc, extension+MIME validation with fallback. Sprint 416 (column detector convergence) chose the adapter pattern — wrapping legacy API over shared implementation rather than rewriting all 5 consumer engines — the right tradeoff of elegance vs blast radius. Sprint 417 (API client safety) applied RFC 9110 idempotency semantics correctly, with LRU eviction bounded at MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES=100 and dev-mode console.warn for unsafe mutation retries — no over-engineering. No hacky workarounds or duplicated logic detected.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Multiple autonomous bug fixes in this cycle: Sprint 414b diagnosed and fixed an infinite re-render loop (root cause: unstable `initialValues` object creating unstable `reset` callback in useEffect deps). Sprint 414c fixed a hydration mismatch on homepage auth-dependent UI. Sprint 420 fixed 3 pre-existing test failures (duplicate checkbox roles from Sprint 412c's accessibility work). Sprint 433 fixed PDF parser corrupt file handling (`pdfplumber.PdfminerException` catch was missing). All fixes were self-contained with root cause analysis documented. No incomplete fixes or back-and-forth patches in the git log. The Sprint 414b fix in particular demonstrates deep understanding of React's referential equality model — the lesson was captured in both `lessons.md` and committed with its own sprint number.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained at the highest level:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint (411-438) has objectives and checkable items written before implementation. Sprint 421 has 3 sub-sprint plans (A/B/C). Phase LVIII has 7 sub-sprint plans.
2. **Verify Plan** — Sprint 411 established lint baselines with bucket analysis before remediation. Sprint 421 planned backend→frontend migration order. Sprint 436 planned feature flag + tier-gating before implementation.
3. **Track Progress** — All sprints marked COMPLETE with work done checklists. Lint baseline comparison tables (Sprint 411→412→413→414→420) show incremental progress tracking.
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections document modified files, new tests, risk assessment, and complexity scores. Sprint 420 includes a shim removal table and deferred items list.
5. **Document Results** — Sprint 422 documents 22 modified files with test delta. Phase LVIII documents 22 new files, 15 modified files, 128 new tests, and 2 new dependencies.
6. **Capture Lessons** — 3 new lessons from Sprints 414b, 415, and 420 added to `lessons.md`.

Git log shows 20 atomic commits (Sprints 412-438) with descriptive messages. The `tasks/todo.md` Active Phase section contains 28 detailed sprint checklists spanning 1,035 lines — comprehensive but well-organized.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Sprint 411's lint baseline uses a simple 4-bucket categorization (auto-fixable/accessibility/semantic/config) — no over-engineered scoring system. The file format abstraction (`FormatProfile` frozen dataclass + enum dispatch) is appropriately scoped for 10 format variants — no factory pattern or plugin system where a simple dict + if/else suffices. Sprint 435's Prometheus metrics use a dedicated `CollectorRegistry` (4 metrics) — minimal surface area, no metrics framework.
- **No Laziness:** The lint remediation was thorough: ALL 687 issues fixed to zero (131 ruff + 55 eslint errors + 501 eslint warnings), not just the easy auto-fixable ones. Sprint 412c fixed all 51 accessibility errors with correct ARIA patterns. Sprint 420 removed 5 shims (migration artifacts) rather than leaving them. Sprint 433 created 18 malformed fixture tests across 7 formats — covering corrupt input for every supported format, not just the new ones.
- **Minimal Impact:** Each sprint's changes are precisely scoped. Sprint 416 touches 1 modified file + 1 new test file. Sprint 417 touches 3 modified files + 1 modified test file. Sprint 432-438 introduces new files without modifying existing parser paths — existing CSV/Excel/TSV/TXT/OFX/QBO/IIF behavior unchanged.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in the entire codebase. Oat & Obsidian design tokens remain consistent.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Archive the Active Phase and determine next phase scope.** The Active Phase section in `tasks/todo.md` contains 28 sprint checklists (Sprints 411-438) spanning 1,035 lines — these should be archived to `tasks/archive/` per the Phase Lifecycle Protocol. Phase LVIII (ODS + cross-format hardening) appears complete and should be wrapped with regression verification, archival, and CLAUDE.md update. The deferred items list includes pandas 3.0 evaluation, React 19 upgrade, and cookie-based auth migration — convene the Agent Council to evaluate next priorities.

### Trend Note

## Audit — 2026-02-25 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 4.6/5.0

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.7   |
| Task Management         | 4/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.6** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase LIX (Hybrid Pricing Model Overhaul) exhibits the strongest planning discipline in project history for a pricing change. A dedicated decision record exists at tasks/decisions/pricing-model-overhaul.md. The 6-sprint decomposition (A: display-name layer, B: seat model, C: trial infrastructure, D: pricing page, E: checkout flow, F: integration testing) reflects correct dependency ordering. The Report Standardization track (Sprints 0-8) shows an independent, well-sequenced 8-sprint plan: metadata foundation, cover page, scope/methodology, text layout, typography, source document transparency, signoff deprecation, QA automation. The Billing Launch Configuration Sprint has a concrete 8-item checklist that is implementation-specific and deterministic. No evidence of mid-sprint pivots or unplanned scope additions.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ remain single-purpose and well-scoped: critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. The project-auditor agent is actively invoked (this audit). Agent boundary discipline is maintained -- no agent has accreted responsibilities outside its stated role.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** tasks/lessons.md opens with 4 new lessons from Phase LIX: (1) Sprint A -- test fixture defaults cascade through the entire suite, documented with full impact and fix strategy; (2) Sprint A -- display-name layer prevents DB enum lock-in, an architectural insight elevated to a reusable pattern; (3) Sprint B -- SQLAlchemy Column(default=) does not apply on bare instantiation, a precise technical finding with two concrete remediation options; (4) Sprint F -- Prometheus counter _total suffix stripping in collect(), a naming convention nuance that would recur without the lesson. All four follow the correction, root cause, prevention rule structure. The Sprint F lesson was the final sprint of the phase, confirming lessons are captured at time of discovery rather than retrospectively.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 3/5
**Finding:** Two related failures are present simultaneously and constitute the material finding of this audit cycle.

First: Billing Launch Sprint -- explicit unchecked verification. The Billing Launch Configuration Sprint in tasks/todo.md shows 7/8 items checked, with item 8 (Verification: pytest billing tests + npm run build) explicitly unchecked. The sprint is marked In Progress. This is unambiguous documentation that the verification step was not performed before the sprint was left in its current state. The Post-Sprint Checklist in tasks/todo.md designates this step MANDATORY.

Second: 122 uncommitted files -- Post-Sprint Checklist final commit step skipped across all completed work. Phase LIX (6 sprints, all marked COMPLETE), Tier ID Rename (marked COMPLETE), Report Standardization Sprints 0-8 (marked COMPLETE), and the Billing Launch Sprint all exist only in the working tree. The most recent git commit is 29a2fa9 per the evidence, yet 122 files remain modified or untracked. The mandatory commit step was not executed for any completed sprint in this cycle.
**Recommendation:** Before beginning any new work: (1) run pytest and npm run build to close the Billing Launch Sprint verification gap and check off item 8; (2) commit all 122 files in appropriately scoped atomic commits following the Sprint X: Description convention. Going forward, treat the git commit as a hard gate -- a sprint cannot be marked COMPLETE in todo.md until the commit sha is recorded. Consider adding the commit sha to each sprint Review section as evidence of completion.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments confirmed across all backend Python and frontend TypeScript files. The display-name layer architecture (tier_display.py as a thin mapping over immutable PostgreSQL enums) is the correct solution to a genuinely constrained problem -- branding change without DB migration risk. The _load_stripe_price_ids() lazy-loader pattern in price_config.py avoids circular imports while deferring environment reads to first use. The backward-compat alias in rate_limits.py reflects the correct tradeoff between clean naming and migration safety. Frozen data structures (frozenset, frozen dataclasses) are used where mutation would be a defect. No over-engineering detected for the complexity of the billing domain changes.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Three documented autonomous bug-fix episodes in this cycle. Sprint A identified and resolved a fixture-default cascade where changing UserTier.PROFESSIONAL entitlements would have silently broken ~30 test files -- the fix required auditing all make_user call sites and updating the conftest default to UserTier.TEAM. Sprint B resolved the SQLAlchemy Column(default=1) bare-instantiation gap before it created flaky test failures. Sprint F caught and corrected the Prometheus _total naming convention mismatch in counter assertions. All three were self-identified (not user-reported), self-contained, and documented in lessons.md with prevention rules. No back-and-forth patches or incomplete fixes in evidence.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 4/5
**Finding:** Five of the six Post-Sprint Checklist sub-practices are consistently applied. Plan First: all sprints have written objectives and checkable items before implementation. Verify Plan: sprint decomposition order reflects dependency analysis (display-name layer before seat model before trial infrastructure is correct sequencing). Track Progress: completed items are individually checked; the Billing Launch Sprint item 8 is correctly left unchecked because the work was not done -- the tracking system is functioning as intended, the workflow is not. Explain Changes: sprint reviews are documented with key decisions. Capture Lessons: 4 new lessons from Phase LIX, actively maintained.

The single gap: the final Post-Sprint Checklist step -- git commit -- was not executed for any sprint completed in this cycle. The Phase Lifecycle Protocol in tasks/todo.md explicitly lists commit as a mandatory wrap step. The 122 uncommitted files represent 6+ sprint cycles of completed work that exists only in the working tree, not in git history. This breaks the auditability of the completion record.
**Recommendation:** Execute the git commits immediately. Enforce the commit step as a prerequisite for marking a sprint COMPLETE -- the checkbox in todo.md must not be set until the commit sha is recorded.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:** Simplicity First -- the display-name layer approach to tier renaming is the simplest solution consistent with PostgreSQL enum constraints: one new file (tier_display.py), one backward-compat alias, zero migration complexity. validate_billing_config() performs environment variable presence checks, not schema validation -- correctly scoped. No Laziness -- the Tier ID Rename was comprehensive: 10 backend test files, 3 frontend test files, 7 backend modules, 5 frontend components/pages, with grep verification confirming zero stale references outside migrations and compat alias. Report Standardization applied source document transparency across the entire PDF memo generator fleet in Sprint 6, not selectively. Minimal Impact -- the display-name layer adds a new file rather than modifying the ORM enum; existing database rows, Stripe metadata, and all downstream consumers are untouched. Sprint scope boundaries respected throughout. Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat and Obsidian design tokens consistent. No dead code introduced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
Commit all 122 uncommitted files in appropriately scoped atomic commits before beginning any new work. The sequence is: (1) run pytest billing tests and npm run build to close the Billing Launch Sprint unchecked verification item; (2) check off item 8 in tasks/todo.md; (3) commit all 122 files across 3-4 appropriately scoped commits (Report Standardization Sprints 0-8, Phase LIX + Tier Rename, Billing Launch Configuration); (4) archive Phase LIX from the Active Phase section per the Phase Lifecycle Protocol. Then convene the Agent Council to determine the next phase scope.

### Trend Note
First score regression in 14 audits. Prior entry (2026-02-23): 5.0/5.0 overall.
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 -> 4.7 (regressed -- A4 dropped from 5 to 3)
- Task Management: 5/5 -> 4/5 (regressed -- Post-Sprint Checklist commit step skipped)
- Core Principles: 5/5 -> 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 -> 4.6 (regressed)

This is the 15th audit. The project remains in the Excellent band (4.6 >= 4.5), but this is the first regression since the audit journal was established. The regression is attributable to a single root cause: the mandatory git commit step in the Post-Sprint Checklist was not executed for any sprint completed in this cycle, and the Billing Launch Sprint verification step was left unchecked while the sprint remains In Progress. Code quality, planning discipline, lessons capture, and autonomous problem-solving remain at peak. The regression is workflow-procedural, not architectural or substantive. It is recoverable in one session.

## Audit — 2026-02-27 | 🟡 Good — minor gaps | Overall: 4.2/5.0 | Entry #18

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.7   |
| Task Management         | 4/5   |
| Core Principles         | 4/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.2** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 4/5
**Finding:** Sprint 447 (Stripe Production Cutover) has a well-structured 8-item checklist with correct dependency ordering (Dashboard configuration before cutover before smoke test). Sprint 445 is marked COMPLETE with verification noted. The planning failure is specific: the Deferred Items table in tasks/todo.md explicitly listed pandas 3.0 upgrade as requiring a dedicated evaluation sprint before adoption. Commit 4f512aa merged the dependabot PR for pandas-3.0.1 without a preceding plan entry, without a dedicated evaluation commit, and without updating the deferred items table. By contrast, the Tailwind v4 migration (also a dependabot bump) was followed by an explicit migration commit (5a34352 Migrate Tailwind CSS v3 to v4) addressing breaking changes — the correct pattern. The pandas upgrade has no equivalent remediation commit. Tests pass at 5,557, but CoW semantics and string dtype changes were explicitly called out as requiring evaluation beyond test passage.
**Recommendation:** Create a dedicated pandas 3.0 evaluation sprint entry in tasks/todo.md. Document which CoW-affected code paths were touched, confirm .copy() usage patterns are intentional, and verify string dtype behavior in the parsing engines. Update the Deferred Items table to reflect actual state — either marked closed with evaluation findings, or re-listed with specific open questions. A deferred item silently absorbed without closure is a tracking liability.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** The prior audit primary finding — 122 uncommitted files — was acted on completely: working tree is clean, all prior sprint work is committed. This is the canonical self-improvement loop: audit identifies gap, gap is closed before next cycle. tasks/lessons.md is documented at 1,000+ lines with extensive Phase LIX, LX, LXI, LXII lessons. No evidence of the same mistake recurring from a prior captured lesson. The pandas 3.0 bypass and Tailwind v4 token risk are current-cycle observations; their capture in lessons.md is a forward-looking expectation for this cycle close.
**Recommendation:** Capture a lesson from the pandas 3.0 dependabot merge pattern: when a dependency flagged as deferred-with-evaluation-requirement is merged via dependabot, the evaluation sprint must still be executed — a green test suite does not substitute for a breaking-change evaluation.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 4/5
**Finding:** The prior audit unchecked verification item (Billing Launch Sprint item 8) is no longer visible as an open item — Phase LX is marked COMPLETE in MEMORY.md and the Active Phase section no longer contains that sprint. This gap appears closed. Current verification posture is otherwise strong: 5,557 backend tests (1 skipped), ~1,190 frontend tests, working tree clean, Sprint 445 explicitly verified. The Tailwind v4 migration regression sequence (bump -> migration commit -> multiple visual fix commits) demonstrates active post-deployment verification. The remaining gap: pandas 3.0 was merged via dependabot and test passage was presumably the sole verification gate. The planned evaluation (Copy-on-Write semantics, string dtype changes, performance baselines) was not executed. This is a verification gap for a dependency flagged as requiring dedicated evaluation.
**Recommendation:** Execute the pandas 3.0 evaluation before Sprint 448 begins: (1) audit all .copy() and .assign() call sites in audit_engine.py, revenue_testing.py, payroll_testing.py, ar_aging.py, fixed_asset_testing.py for CoW compliance; (2) verify string dtype behavior in column detection is unchanged; (3) run a performance baseline on TB upload with a large fixture to confirm no regression. Document findings in the sprint review.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** The Tailwind v4 migration reflects the correct approach: dependabot handled the version bump, a dedicated commit (5a34352) addressed v3->v4 configuration breaking changes, and subsequent targeted commits corrected specific visual regressions (7ac87b9 Fix bottom clipping, f56f138 Oatmeal screen background, 7ae02d4 Compact hero panel). Each fix is scoped to the specific regression, not a broad rewrite. The company name toolbar addition (8bc789c) is a single-commit minimal-impact change. No TODO/FIXME/HACK commits visible in the git log. Recent commits show surgical precision — none touch unrelated areas.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** The Tailwind v4 migration generated visual regressions that were diagnosed and fixed autonomously across multiple commits: bc477ca Fix hero walkthrough animation stuck at opacity 0, 7ac87b9 Fix bottom clipping and replace grainy background with solid color, f56f138 Oatmeal screen background single-line subtitle light-on-dark layer colors, 7ae02d4 Compact hero panel reduce whitespace clear navbar overlap. Each fix has a specific descriptive commit message identifying the exact symptom. No back-and-forth with user direction required. No incomplete fixes left open. The pattern of bump -> migrate -> fix regressions is a complete autonomous resolution cycle.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 4/5
**Finding:** Five of six sub-practices are consistently applied. Plan First: Sprint 447 has a proper structured checklist. Track Progress: Sprint 445 marked COMPLETE with verification. Explain Changes: sprint reviews present. Capture Lessons: prior cycle lessons documented. The prior audit commit gap is closed — working tree is clean.

Two gaps remain. First: the Deferred Items table still lists pandas 3.0 upgrade as deferred, but commit 4f512aa already merged pandas-3.0.1 into the backend. The tracking document and the codebase are out of sync. A deferred item was bypassed without a corresponding closure or update in the tracking record. Second: commit SHAs are still not recorded in sprint Review sections. The prior audit recommended this as a hard gate — a sprint cannot be marked COMPLETE until the commit sha is recorded. No evidence this recommendation was implemented in the Active Phase structure.
**Recommendation:** (1) Update the Deferred Items table immediately: either document the pandas 3.0 evaluation findings and mark it closed, or re-list it as an active risk with specific open questions. (2) Add a Commit SHA field to the sprint Review section template in tasks/todo.md so every completed sprint has a verifiable record.

### C. Core Principles — 4/5
**Finding:** Simplicity First and No Laziness are well-maintained. The Tailwind v4 migration was executed with the correct migrate-config-then-fix-regressions discipline rather than a band-aid approach. Company name addition is the correct minimal change. Zero-Storage compliance is maintained — no new persistence patterns in recent commits. The Minimal Impact concern is specific to the Oat and Obsidian design mandate: Tailwind v4 moves from tailwind.config.js color extensions to CSS-first configuration, which changes how custom tokens (obsidian/oatmeal/clay/sage) are declared and inherited. Multiple visual regression commits after the migration (f56f138, 7ac87b9) indicate some token rendering was disrupted. A tailwind.config.js file appears in the changed files set, suggesting token definitions were addressed, but there is no explicit audit evidence that every Oat and Obsidian semantic token survived with full fidelity across all 100+ affected frontend components. The design mandate is STRICT and carries audit score penalties.
**Recommendation:** Perform an explicit Oat and Obsidian token audit post-Tailwind v4 migration. Grep for any hardcoded hex values or generic Tailwind color classes (slate-*, blue-*, green-*, red-*) introduced during the migration. Verify the theme block in globals.css defines all four core tokens and their scale variants. Document the verification result in a sprint review entry.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Execute the pandas 3.0 evaluation sprint.** The package is already in the codebase. The CoW semantics and string dtype changes that prompted the dedicated evaluation sprint requirement are present and unverified. Specifically: audit all .copy(), .assign(), and chained-indexing patterns in the five heaviest pandas consumers (audit_engine.py, revenue_testing.py, payroll_testing.py, ar_aging.py, fixed_asset_testing.py), run a performance baseline on TB upload with a 10,000-row fixture, document findings, update the Deferred Items table, and close the item. This is the only open verification gap that could surface a silent behavioral regression in production.

### Trend Note
Score regressed from prior audit (2026-02-25). This is the second regression in two consecutive audits.
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.7 -> 4.7 (flat — A1 and A4 both remain at 4, same structural category of gaps as prior cycle)
- Task Management: 4/5 -> 4/5 (flat — prior audit commit gap closed, but deferred-item tracking gap opened)
- Core Principles: 5/5 -> 4/5 (regressed — Tailwind v4 token fidelity uncertainty introduces a design mandate compliance risk)
- Overall: 4.6 -> 4.2 (regressed — dropped from Excellent band to Good band)

This is the 16th audit. The project has dropped from the Excellent band (>=4.5) to the Good band (4.2) for the first time. Two structural issues are driving the regression: (1) a deferred item (pandas 3.0) was absorbed into the codebase without executing the planned evaluation, creating a tracking inconsistency and an unverified behavioral risk; (2) the Tailwind v4 migration introduced uncertainty around Oat and Obsidian token fidelity that has not been formally verified. The prior cycle procedural regression (uncommitted files) was resolved completely and is not a factor here. The new regressions are substantive: one is a dependency governance gap, one is a design mandate compliance gap. Both are recoverable in one evaluation sprint.

### A1. Plan Mode Default -- 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 448 is the direct, complete execution of the evaluation sprint that the prior audit identified as missing. The scope was concrete before any code was written: CoW audit across affected call sites, dtype check, performance baseline on a 10,000-row fixture. The evaluation was executed exactly as planned. The prior A1 finding was pandas merged without a plan entry. That gap is now closed -- the plan entry was created, the evaluation was run, a real breaking change was caught and fixed, and the Deferred Items table was updated to RESOLVED with findings. This is plan-mode default operating correctly: deferred item flagged with evaluation requirement, dependabot bump occurred, dedicated sprint executed the evaluation that was always required, findings documented.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy -- 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop -- 5/5
**Finding:** The prior audit recommended capturing a lesson from the pandas/dependabot merge pattern -- specifically that a green test suite does not substitute for a breaking-change evaluation when a dependency was flagged as deferred-with-evaluation-requirement. Three new lessons were added to tasks/lessons.md this cycle: (1) pandas string dtype breaking change -- pd.StringDtype() vs object dtype guard bypass; (2) dependabot governance for deferred items -- the evaluation sprint must execute regardless of test passage; (3) safe CoW patterns verified list -- enumerate which patterns are confirmed safe for reference. The loop operated precisely as designed: audit flags gap, lesson is captured, lesson prevents recurrence. Three lessons from a single sprint indicates active capture discipline, not retrospective documentation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done -- 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 448 constitutes rigorous verification: (1) full CoW audit across all affected call sites -- df.copy(), iloc[].copy(), dict accumulators, column reassignment all confirmed safe; (2) dtype check that caught a real breaking change -- df[col].dtype == object guard bypassed by pandas 3.0 pd.StringDtype for CSV string columns, silently disabling the cell-length OOM protection; (3) performance baseline -- 10,000-row TB parse at 46ms avg across 3 trials; (4) 5,557 tests pass, 1 skipped -- identical count. One real production bug was caught and fixed. This is verification done correctly: not just test passage, but a structured evaluation across behavioral dimensions. The prior A4 finding was pandas evaluation not executed. That finding is fully resolved. Fix committed as 0cbc8ab in the same sprint, confirming verification and correction happened in a single atomic cycle.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.
### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) -- 5/5
**Finding:** The fix is a single-line replacement in shared/helpers.py:571 -- df[col].dtype == object replaced by pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(df[col]). This is the correct pandas-idiomatic API: it handles all string dtype variants (Python object, pd.StringDtype, ArrowDtype with string backing) without requiring enumeration of dtype variants. The OOM protection guard was preserved and made dtype-agnostic rather than bypassed. No over-engineering: one function call replaced one equality check. The change is in the correct shared utility location. No ancillary files were modified.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing -- 5/5
**Finding:** The dtype bug was identified autonomously during the evaluation pass -- not user-reported, not surfaced by tests. Root cause correctly diagnosed: pandas 3.0 changed the default dtype for string columns in CSV parsing from Python object to pd.StringDtype, which evaluates to false on the == object comparison, silently bypassing the cell-length OOM guard in shared/helpers.py. The fix was precise, targeted, and committed in the same sprint with a descriptive message (fix string dtype guard). No back-and-forth. No incomplete state. The bug would have been invisible in testing because the guard omission does not cause test failures -- it only manifests under adversarial inputs with very long cell values. Catching it during a planned evaluation rather than in production is the correct outcome.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management -- 4/5
**Finding:** Five of six sub-practices are now applied at the highest level. Plan First: Sprint 448 had concrete scope before execution. Track Progress: Deferred Items table updated to RESOLVED with findings -- the tracking gap from the prior audit is closed. Explain Changes: sprint review documents all three evaluation dimensions plus the specific bug and fix. Capture Lessons: 3 new lessons added. Document Results: completion notes in tasks/todo.md, Sprint 448 added to Completed Phases in CLAUDE.md.

One gap persists across two consecutive audits without implementation: commit SHAs are not recorded as a formal field in sprint Review sections. The prior audit explicitly recommended this as a hard gate -- a sprint cannot be marked COMPLETE until the commit SHA is recorded in the sprint Review section. Sprint 448 commit is 0cbc8ab; there is no evidence this SHA appears in the todo.md sprint Review entry. This recommendation has been raised in the 16th and 17th audits without implementation. It does not drop the score below 4 because all substantive sub-practices are strong, but a repeated unimplemented recommendation from a prior audit is a process discipline signal.
**Recommendation:** Add a Commit SHA field to the sprint Review section template in tasks/todo.md. Record 0cbc8ab for Sprint 448 as the first instance. This is a one-time template change and one-line entry -- the implementation cost is trivial and the recommendation has now been raised twice.

### C. Core Principles -- 5/5
**Finding:** Both prior C concerns are fully resolved. Tailwind v4 token audit: tailwind.config.js confirmed to define all four core tokens (obsidian, oatmeal, clay, sage) with full scale variants; 0 occurrences of generic color classes (slate-*, blue-*, green-*, red-*, gray-*) across all .tsx/.ts/.css source files -- the Oat and Obsidian design mandate is fully intact post-migration. Pandas evaluation: the process gap (deferred item absorbed without evaluation) is closed. Simplicity First: single-line dtype fix using the correct stdlib API. No Laziness: the full evaluation was executed -- CoW audit, dtype check, perf baseline -- not just test passage. Minimal Impact: the change touches exactly one function in one shared utility file; no other files were modified. Zero-Storage compliance maintained throughout.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.
### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Implement the Commit SHA field in the sprint Review section template.** This is the only remaining open process gap identified across the last two audits. The implementation cost is trivial: add one Commit SHA field to the standard Review section template in tasks/todo.md, record 0cbc8ab for Sprint 448, and enforce it as a completion gate going forward. Once implemented, all six Task Management sub-practices will be operating at the highest level and Pillar B will be eligible to return to 5/5. Sprint 447 (Stripe Production Cutover) remains correctly deferred pending external dependencies (CEO sign-off + live keys) -- no action required there.

### Trend Note
Strong recovery from two consecutive regression cycles.
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.7 -> 5.0 (recovered -- all six A pillars at 5/5; A1 and A4 both resolved by Sprint 448 execution)
- Task Management: 4/5 -> 4/5 (flat -- prior tracking gap closed, but commit SHA field recommendation unimplemented for second consecutive audit)
- Core Principles: 4/5 -> 5/5 (recovered -- both prior concerns resolved: pandas evaluation complete, Tailwind v4 token fidelity confirmed at 0 generic classes)
- Overall: 4.2 -> 4.7 (recovered -- returned to Excellent band from Good band)

This is the 17th audit. The project has returned to the Excellent band (4.7 >= 4.5) after one cycle in the Good band. The recovery is attributable to Sprint 448: a single well-scoped evaluation sprint that closed four open audit findings simultaneously (A1 plan gap, A4 verification gap, B tracking gap via Deferred Items update, C process gap via evaluation execution). The one remaining open item -- commit SHA as a formal sprint Review field -- is the sole structural gap preventing a return to 5.0 overall. It has now been raised in two consecutive audits. The self-improvement loop is demonstrably functioning: audit identifies gaps, gaps are closed in the next cycle, lessons are captured.

## Audit -- 2026-02-27 (18th) | Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default -- 5/5
**Finding:** No new sprints were initiated this cycle. Sprint 447 (Stripe Production Cutover) remains correctly PENDING, gated on external non-automatable dependencies (CEO sign-off + sk_live_ keys). The only work performed this session was a single-item template addition to the Post-Sprint Checklist (SHA field) and a one-line backfill of Sprint 448 review entry -- both the direct output of the 17th audit top priority recommendation. This is plan-mode default in its most lightweight form: a trivial change executed from a clear prior specification, no re-planning required.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy -- 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in .claude/agents/ (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat detected. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep or role overlap.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop -- 5/5
**Finding:** The 17th audit raised the SHA field recommendation for the second consecutive time and flagged it as a repeated unimplemented recommendation -- a process discipline signal. That signal was acted on this session: item 7 of the Post-Sprint Checklist in tasks/todo.md now reads "Record commit SHA in sprint Review section (e.g., Commit: abc1234)", and Sprint 448 review entry was backfilled with "Commit: 0cbc8ab". The loop completed in one cycle after the second raising: audit flags persistence, implementation follows before next audit. Three Sprint 448 lessons remain on file in tasks/lessons.md (pandas string dtype, dependabot governance, CoW safe patterns). No lesson-covered mistake is visible in recent commits.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done -- 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 447 is correctly held at PENDING with all checklist items unchecked -- the sprint cannot proceed until external dependencies are satisfied. The SHA addition and Sprint 448 backfill are documentation-only changes with no build or test surface area; no verification gate applies. The last sprint with code changes (Sprint 448, commit 0cbc8ab) was verified at 5,557 tests passing, 1 skipped -- unchanged since prior audit. No incomplete verification state exists anywhere in the project.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) -- 5/5
**Finding:** The SHA field addition is a single-line markdown edit -- the minimum viable implementation of the recommendation. No over-engineering: the field is plain text (Commit: abc1234), not a structured schema or automated extraction system. The Sprint 448 backfill is one line appended to an existing review entry. These changes touch exactly what they need to touch and nothing else. Prior codebase quality posture (0 TODO/FIXME/HACK, single-line dtype fix, surgical Sprint 448 scope) is unchanged.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing -- 5/5
**Finding:** No bugs were introduced or present this cycle. The audit-journal.md unstaged state is expected and correct -- it is an audit artifact accumulating entries during the session, not sprint work, and the Post-Sprint Checklist does not govern it. No back-and-forth or incomplete fixes are visible. The prior Sprint 448 dtype fix (0cbc8ab) remains the most recent code change and was self-contained.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider committing audit-journal.md as a standalone commit after each audit session to preserve the record in git history.

### B. Task Management -- 5/5
**Finding:** All six sub-practices are now operating with structural implementation -- the first time Pillar B has scored 5/5 since its regression in the 15th audit cycle.
1. Plan First -- Sprint 447 has a complete structured checklist before any implementation begins.
2. Verify Plan -- Sprint 447 correctly held PENDING; external gate items are correctly unchecked pending CEO sign-off and live Stripe keys.
3. Track Progress -- Sprint 448 marked COMPLETE with backfilled SHA. Deferred Items table updated to RESOLVED with evaluation findings (prior cycle).
4. Explain Changes -- Sprint 448 review documents CoW audit scope, dtype finding and fix location, performance baseline, and test count.
5. Document Results -- Completion notes in tasks/todo.md and CLAUDE.md. SHA backfill closes the final documentation gap.
6. Capture Lessons -- Three new lessons from Sprint 448 on file. Prior audit recommendation acted on within one cycle.

The SHA field -- raised in the 16th and 17th audits without implementation -- now has structural enforcement: it is item 7 of the mandatory Post-Sprint Checklist, not an informal recommendation. Sprint 448 is the first sprint with a formally recorded SHA in the review section. No sub-practice gap remains.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Enforce the SHA field as a hard completion gate -- a sprint review entry without a SHA is structurally incomplete under the Post-Sprint Checklist.

### C. Core Principles -- 5/5
**Finding:** Simplicity First: the SHA field is a plain-text one-liner; the checklist template edit adds one bullet to an existing list without restructuring the format. No Laziness: the recommendation was implemented completely -- both template update and Sprint 448 backfill -- rather than partially. Minimal Impact: the only modified files are tasks/todo.md (template + Sprint 448 entry) and audit-journal.md (this audit). Zero-Storage compliance unchanged. Oat and Obsidian design mandate unchanged -- no frontend modifications this cycle. No dead code, no commented-out sections, no shortcuts introduced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Commit audit-journal.md to preserve the audit record.** The journal file is modified and unstaged -- it contains the 16th, 17th, and now 18th audit entries. These entries constitute the project workflow compliance record and should be committed as a standalone atomic commit (e.g., "Audit: append 16th-18th audit journal entries"). This is not sprint work and should be a separate commit from any future sprint activity. Once committed, the working tree returns to clean and the audit record is durable in git history. After that, Sprint 447 awaits only external inputs (CEO sign-off + sk_live_ keys) -- no automatable work remains.

### Trend Note
Full recovery to 5.0/5.0 -- the first perfect score since the 14th audit (2026-02-23).
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 -> 5.0 (maintained -- all six A pillars at 5/5 for second consecutive audit)
- Task Management: 4/5 -> 5/5 (recovered -- SHA field structurally implemented in Post-Sprint Checklist; Sprint 448 backfilled; all six sub-practices now operational)
- Core Principles: 5/5 -> 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 4.7 -> 5.0 (recovered -- returned to peak score)

This is the 18th audit. The project has returned to 5.0/5.0 for the first time since the 14th audit. The sole persistent gap across the 16th and 17th audits (commit SHA not recorded as a formal Post-Sprint Checklist item) is now fully resolved: structural implementation in the template, one-line backfill for Sprint 448, and the self-improvement loop completed its cycle. The audit-journal.md unstaged state is the only noteworthy item and is benign -- it is an expected artifact of the audit session. All three pillars are at their maximum. Sprint 447 correctly awaits external inputs. No automatable remediation work is open.

## Audit — 2026-02-27 (19th) | 🟡 Good — minor gaps | Overall: 4.2/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.7   |
| Task Management         | 3/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.2** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 4/5
**Finding:** Two work items this cycle. Phase LXIII (Entitlement Enforcement Wiring) was planned correctly: Sprint LXIII-1 and Sprint LXIII-2 have complete structured checklists in tasks/todo.md with objectives, line-by-line tasks, and verification steps written before implementation. The HttpOnly Cookie Session Hardening sprint was planned in a detailed external plan file (`.claude/plans/resilient-sniffing-lecun.md`) — the plan covered all 9 files, cookie attributes, known simplifications, and verification commands. However, the mandatory directive protocol requires writing the plan to `tasks/todo.md` as a checklist before implementation begins ("Before ANY implementation begins: Read tasks/todo.md, Add/update checklist items for the current directive"). The plan remained only in the plan file; no entry exists in tasks/todo.md. This is a protocol gap, not a planning quality gap — the plan itself was thorough.
**Recommendation:** The plan file is an acceptable planning artifact but cannot substitute for the todo.md entry. Before beginning any future sprint, create the todo.md checklist first (even if it mirrors the plan file structure). The mandatory protocol exists so progress tracking and review documentation occur in a single canonical location.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across multiple consecutive audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 4/5
**Finding:** tasks/lessons.md is actively maintained with real corrections. The Sprint 448 section (lines 20–38) contains three precisely scoped lessons from last cycle with root cause and prevention rules. The Phase LXII section (lines 42–64) has three additional lessons. The prior audit's self-improvement loop operated correctly: the 17th and 18th audit top priorities were acted on (SHA field + pandas evaluation). The gap this cycle: the HttpOnly Cookie sprint required 4 CSRF test case updates in `test_csrf_middleware.py` when `/auth/logout` was removed from `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS`. This was a concrete correction during implementation that should have generated a lesson: "When modifying CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS, all tests that assert specific path membership must be updated." No lesson was captured. The pattern is non-obvious enough (test semantics diverge from implementation intent when exempt path policy changes) to warrant documentation.
**Recommendation:** Add a lesson to tasks/lessons.md: when a path is added to or removed from CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS, search all test files for assertions on that specific path (both positive `in` and negative `not in` assertions) and update them before marking the sprint complete. The CSRF test suite contains 4 tests that directly assert exempt set membership — this is a maintenance point that must be tracked.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase LXIII verification is fully documented in the todo.md review section: Sprint LXIII-1 ran `pytest tests/test_audit_api.py -v` (8/8 passed) and full pytest (5,561 passed, 1 skipped). Sprint LXIII-2 ran `npm run build` with 0 errors, all 39 routes compiled. HttpOnly Cookie sprint: 5,557 tests passed (4 CSRF test failures were identified, fixed, and re-verified), frontend build passed. Both work items are verified against the mandatory Post-Sprint Checklist. The SHA field (added in the 18th audit cycle) was used for Sprint LXIII — the todo.md review section contains "Full `pytest` — 5,561 passed, 1 skipped." The HttpOnly sprint's SHA is `7ed278f` — not yet recorded in a todo.md review because no todo.md entry exists (per the A1 finding).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice for all sprints with todo.md entries. Close the HttpOnly sprint verification record by creating the retroactive entry in tasks/todo.md with the commit SHA `7ed278f`.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** The HttpOnly Cookie implementation is clean and minimal. Two module-level helpers (`_set_refresh_cookie`, `_clear_refresh_cookie`) encapsulate the cookie attribute bundle — DRY without over-abstraction. `tokenRef = useRef<string | null>(null)` is the idiomatic React pattern for in-memory non-rendered state. The CSRF removal of `/auth/logout` from `CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS` is architecturally correct: the endpoint is now cookie-authenticated, so the user always has a valid CSRF token at logout time. Cookie scoped to `path="/auth"` minimizes attack surface. Known simplification on `remember_me` rotation (session cookie always issued on rotation) is documented rather than over-engineered. Phase LXIII's `check_diagnostic_limit` as a FastAPI dependency chain is the correct injection pattern. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in any of the 9 changed files.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Four CSRF test failures surfaced immediately after the main implementation: `test_auth_logout_exempt` (asserted `/auth/logout` in exempt set), `test_all_new_exempt_paths_pass` (included `/auth/logout` in the tested list), `test_logout_exempt_documented` (checked for "Authorization header" text removed from the updated comment), and `test_exempt_set_is_frozen` (expected set included `/auth/logout`). All four were diagnosed and fixed autonomously — root cause correctly identified (tests asserted the old CSRF policy, not the new one), and each test was updated to assert the new invariant rather than simply suppressed. No user direction required. No back-and-forth. No incomplete fixes.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 3/5
**Finding:** Two of three work items this cycle followed the mandatory directive protocol correctly. Phase LXIII has a complete plan in tasks/todo.md (Sprint LXIII-1 and LXIII-2 checklists with objectives and incremental tracking), a review section, and the Phase LXIII section marked "IN PROGRESS" in the Active Phase. Sprint 448 (prior cycle) has a properly backfilled review entry with commit SHA. The HttpOnly Cookie sprint completely bypassed the protocol:

1. **Plan First** — No entry in tasks/todo.md before or after implementation.
2. **Track Progress** — No checklist existed to track against; no incremental marking.
3. **Document Results** — No review section in tasks/todo.md.
4. **Capture Lessons** — No lesson added despite 4 test case corrections during implementation.
5. **Deferred Item not closed** — The Deferred Items table still shows "Cookie-based auth (SSR) | Large blast radius; requires JWT → httpOnly cookie migration | Phase XXVII" as open. This work is now complete; the item was not marked RESOLVED with findings.
6. **Commit naming convention** — Message is "Sprint: HttpOnly Cookie Session Hardening" rather than the established "Sprint X: Description" convention (missing sprint number, no Phase reference).

One work item out of two code-change sprints bypassed every sub-practice in the protocol. The bypass is procedural rather than substantive — the code quality is high — but the tracking discipline failure is real and documented.
**Recommendation:** Create the HttpOnly Cookie sprint entry in tasks/todo.md retroactively: write objectives, the verification results (5,557 tests passed, build clean), and a review section with Commit: 7ed278f. Update the Deferred Items table to mark "Cookie-based auth (SSR)" as RESOLVED with findings summary. Add the CSRF test update lesson to tasks/lessons.md. Going forward, treat the todo.md checklist as the first artifact created for any sprint — before opening any files.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:** Both work items are surgically scoped. Phase LXIII touched exactly 2 backend files + test file updates (LXIII-1) and 7 frontend tool pages + shared index (LXIII-2). The HttpOnly Cookie sprint touched exactly 9 files as specified in the plan (config.py, auth.py, auth_routes.py, security_middleware.py, auth.ts, AuthContext.tsx, login/page.tsx assessment deferred per plan, test_auth_routes_api.py, test_csrf_middleware.py, test_refresh_tokens.py). No unrelated modifications in either commit. Zero-Storage compliance was strengthened by the cookie migration: `TOKEN_KEY`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY`, `REMEMBER_ME_KEY` constants removed from AuthContext, `getStoredRefreshToken()` / `storeRefreshToken()` deleted, all `localStorage.*` and `sessionStorage.*` token writes eliminated. The only remaining storage call is `USER_KEY` (non-sensitive user metadata for UI hydration). Oat and Obsidian design tokens not touched by either sprint.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Retroactively complete the HttpOnly Cookie sprint's mandatory protocol artifacts.** Three specific actions: (1) Add a sprint entry to the Active Phase section of tasks/todo.md with objectives, verification results (5,557 tests passed, build clean, 4 CSRF test fixes), and review with Commit: 7ed278f. (2) Update the Deferred Items table to mark "Cookie-based auth (SSR)" as RESOLVED with a one-line summary of what was implemented. (3) Add a lesson to tasks/lessons.md about CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS test maintenance. These three actions close all procedural gaps from this cycle and bring Task Management back to 4/5 at minimum. Total implementation cost: ~15 minutes of documentation. The code is correct and complete — only the tracking record is missing.

### Trend Note
Regression from 5.0 (18th audit) to 4.2 (19th audit) — a single-cycle relapse.
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 4.7 (regressed — A1 dropped from 5 to 4; HttpOnly plan not in todo.md. A3 dropped from 5 to 4; CSRF lesson not captured)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 3/5 (regressed — HttpOnly sprint bypassed all six sub-practices; deferred item not closed; commit naming convention broken)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained — surgical implementation, Zero-Storage strengthened)
- Overall: 5.0 → 4.2 (regressed — returned to Good band)

This is the 19th audit. The regression is driven by a single sprint (HttpOnly Cookie Session Hardening) that was technically excellent but procedurally bypassed the mandatory directive protocol entirely. The code changes are correct and the test suite passes. The gap is documentation and tracking discipline. Phase LXIII, which ran concurrently, followed the protocol correctly — confirming the capability exists and the HttpOnly bypass was situational rather than systemic. The prior audit cycle's recovery was real; this is a one-sprint slip, not a structural regression. All three prior remediation actions (SHA field, pandas evaluation, deferred items table) remain correctly closed.

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.7   |
| Task Management         | 4/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.6** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 4/5
**Finding:** This cycle spans two distinct work categories with divergent planning discipline. The SOC 2 readiness track (Sprints 449–459, 11 sprints) is the strongest planning example in the project's history for a compliance initiative: each sprint has a SOC 2 criteria reference (CC8.4, CC7.2, S1.5, PI4.3, CC4.2, CC7.4, CC2.2, CC6.1, PI1.3), explicit scope definition, and pre-implementation checklists with 8–13 items each. Sprint 459 (DPA Acceptance Workflow) has a 17-item checklist covering backend, frontend, migration, tests, and documentation — textbook plan-before-execute. Phase LXVII (Visual Polish) has a 4-sprint plan with pre-sprint bugfixes, regression gates, and clear acceptance criteria. Sprint 450b (Hero Animation) has a 7-item plan with verification step.

The planning gap is in the homepage visual work: PR #20 (commit 5fe6282, "Sprint 449: Homepage tool slideshow + hero timeline scrubber") and PR #21 (6 commits: homepage reorganization, nav styling, ProofStrip removal, auto-play cycling) have no todo.md entries. PR #20 is additionally mislabeled as "Sprint 449" in its commit message, colliding with the SOC 2 Sprint 449 (GitHub PR Security Checklist Template, commit e09941a) — a sprint number collision that degrades tracking data integrity. PR #21's 6 commits represent non-trivial work (component removal, nav restructuring, auto-play state management) that warranted a plan entry.
**Recommendation:** Create retroactive todo.md entries for the homepage tool slideshow (PR #20) and homepage reorganization (PR #21). Assign distinct sprint numbers — PR #20's "Sprint 449" label conflicts with the SOC 2 Sprint 449. Going forward, assign sprint numbers at plan-creation time, not commit time, to prevent collisions. Visual/UI work requires the same mandatory directive protocol as backend work — there is no complexity exemption.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent) remain single-purpose with stable role boundaries. No consolidation or bloat since prior audit. Project-auditor is actively invoked (this audit). Agent roster has been stable across 5+ consecutive audit cycles with no evidence of scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 4/5
**Finding:** The 19th audit made three specific recommendations as its top priority: (1) Add a detailed HttpOnly Cookie sprint entry to Active Phase in tasks/todo.md with verification results and commit SHA 7ed278f; (2) Update the Deferred Items table to mark "Cookie-based auth (SSR)" as RESOLVED; (3) Add the CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS test maintenance lesson to tasks/lessons.md.

Item 3 was fully implemented — `tasks/lessons.md` contains a precise lesson at the "Phase LXIV: HttpOnly Cookie Session Hardening" section: "CSRF_EXEMPT_PATHS Changes Require a Test Audit Pass" with a specific prevention rule (grep for the affected path in test files before running the suite). This is exactly what was requested.

Item 2 was partially implemented — the Deferred Items table entry for "Marketing pages SSG" now reads "HttpOnly cookie prereq met (Phase LXIV)" which acknowledges completion, but the original deferred item "Cookie-based auth (SSR)" was not explicitly marked RESOLVED with findings.

Item 1 was not implemented — no detailed sprint entry exists in the Active Phase section for HttpOnly Cookie. Phase LXIV appears only as a one-liner in the Completed Phases section without verification record or commit SHA.

Implementation rate on prior audit top priority: 1.5 out of 3 recommendations acted on. The self-improvement loop captures specific corrections (CSRF lesson) but drops broader process artifacts (retroactive sprint entries, deferred item closure).
**Recommendation:** Complete the two remaining 19th audit recommendations before the next cycle: (1) add HttpOnly Cookie sprint to Active Phase with objectives, verification, review, and Commit: 7ed278f — then immediately archive to Completed Phases; (2) update the Deferred Items table to explicitly show the original "Cookie-based auth (SSR)" item as RESOLVED. Capture a systemic lesson: "All prior audit top priority actions must be completed before beginning new work — partial implementation is a recurring gap."

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** All code-change sprints show verification evidence. Sprint 450b has `[x] npm run build passes (40 routes, 0 errors)` in its todo.md entry. Sprint 459 (DPA Acceptance Workflow) has `[x] npm run build passes (40 dynamic routes, no errors)` and `[x] pytest passes (5,620 tests)`. SOC 2 documentation sprints appropriately note `[x] npm run build passes (no backend changes)` where applicable. The working tree is clean — `git status` returns no output, confirming all work is committed. The most recent merge (PR #23, commit 28439dc) confirms Sprint 450b was successfully pushed and merged. No incomplete verification state exists.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Zero actual TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in the codebase. The 23 grep matches (9 frontend, 14 backend) are all false positives: sprint references in docstrings matching the "XXX" pattern (e.g., "Sprint 281: Phase XXXVIII") and the OFX parser date format specification "YYYYMMDD[HHmmss[.XXX]]". Recently modified files demonstrate professional quality: `HeroProductFilm.tsx` uses typed constants (`FilmStep`, `STEP_POSITIONS`), proper React hooks (`useCallback`, `useEffect`), hydration guard pattern, and `useReducedMotion` accessibility compliance. `checkout.py` has clear docstrings, typed parameters with defaults, and server-side URL derivation (the security pattern captured as a lesson in prior cycles). The DPA acceptance workflow (`a4b5c6d7e8f9` migration) correctly adds nullable columns to avoid migration failures on existing data. No hacky workarounds, no duplicated logic, no over-engineering.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** The homepage reorganization (PR #21) demonstrates autonomous iterative refinement across 6 self-directed commits: `562ac56` (reorganize menu, fix Sign In visibility), `cc47911` (remove ProofStrip, rename heading), `248d8c7` (glassmorphic Sign In button), `4363459` (add auto-play cycling), `4ebbc85` (move play/pause toggle), `5788e1e` (clean up duplicate capabilities, drop auto-play). Each commit addresses a specific visual/UX issue with a descriptive message. The final commit (`5788e1e`) shows self-correction: auto-play was added in `4363459` then removed in `5788e1e` after evaluation — the correct outcome when a feature doesn't meet quality standards. No incomplete fixes, no back-and-forth patches, no user-directed corrections visible in the git log. Sprint 459 (DPA workflow) was a complete end-to-end implementation (backend model → migration → checkout flow → webhook handler → frontend pages → documentation) executed in a single atomic commit.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 4/5
**Finding:** Five of six sub-practices are consistently applied for the substantial intellectual work this cycle. The SOC 2 readiness track (11 sprints) follows every sub-practice rigorously: plans written before implementation, progress tracked incrementally, results documented with review sections and commit SHAs, lessons captured where applicable. Phase LXVII Visual Polish is marked COMPLETE with regression verification. The Design Guidelines Sprint has a proper Review section.

Three gaps prevent a 5/5 score:

1. **Sprint 450b stale tracking** — The todo.md entry shows Status: IN PROGRESS with `[ ] Commit and push` unchecked, but the work was committed (`a5e4bfc`), pushed, and merged via PR #23 (`28439dc`). The sprint should be Status: COMPLETE with a Review section containing Commit: a5e4bfc. The Post-Sprint Checklist was not executed.

2. **Two untracked work items** — PR #20 (homepage tool slideshow, commit `5fe6282`) and PR #21 (homepage reorganization, 6 commits) have no todo.md entries whatsoever. No plan, no progress tracking, no review, no verification record. The mandatory directive protocol was bypassed for both.

3. **Sprint number collision** — PR #20's commit is labeled "Sprint 449" but Sprint 449 in todo.md is the SOC 2 PR Security Checklist Template (commit `e09941a`). Two distinct work items share the same sprint number, degrading the tracking system's referential integrity.

The pattern is consistent with the 19th audit's finding: backend and compliance work follows the protocol; visual/UI work bypasses it. The compliance rate by count is ~81% (13 of 16 work items), but the recurring nature of the visual-work bypass — now spanning three audit cycles (HttpOnly in 19th, homepage work in 20th) — elevates it beyond "minor gap."
**Recommendation:** (1) Close Sprint 450b: update status to COMPLETE, add Review section with Commit: a5e4bfc. (2) Create retroactive entries for PR #20 and PR #21 with objectives, verification, and commit SHAs. (3) Resolve the Sprint 449 number collision by assigning PR #20 a distinct sprint number (e.g., Sprint 449b or renaming the commit in the todo.md entry). (4) Capture a systemic lesson: "Visual/UI work requires the same mandatory directive protocol as backend/compliance work. The protocol has no complexity or category exemption."

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** The DPA acceptance workflow adds exactly what's needed: 2 nullable columns on `Subscription` (`dpa_accepted_at`, `dpa_version`), a checkbox on the checkout page, webhook metadata propagation, and a billing page display. No over-engineered consent management framework. The SOC 2 documentation sprints produce focused, single-purpose artifacts (training curriculum, access review template, deletion procedure) — each one scoped to its SOC 2 criterion. The hero animation redesign is contained to `HeroProductFilm.tsx` with no modifications to surrounding components.
- **No Laziness:** The SOC 2 sprints are thorough: Sprint 453 (Security Training) produced 5 full written modules with Paciolus-specific controls; Sprint 456 (Data Deletion) has a 10-step procedure with exact SQL queries for all 7 affected tables; Sprint 454 (Access Review) covers 7 systems with per-row CEO instructions. Sprint 450b's hero redesign replaced generic content with real product capability representation across all three animation layers.
- **Minimal Impact:** Each commit touches only its target files. Sprint 459 (DPA) modifies exactly the billing files needed (checkout.py, webhook_handler.py, billing routes, subscription model, migration, frontend checkout + billing pages). The homepage reorganization commits are individually scoped — ProofStrip removal is one commit, nav styling is another, auto-play is its own commit. No unrelated modifications detected.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat and Obsidian design tokens consistent — no generic Tailwind colors introduced. No dead code, no commented-out sections.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Close the Sprint 450b tracking gap and create retroactive entries for untracked homepage work.** Three specific actions: (1) Update Sprint 450b in todo.md to Status: COMPLETE, check the "Commit and push" checkbox, add a Review section with Commit: a5e4bfc. (2) Create todo.md entries for PR #20 (homepage tool slideshow) and PR #21 (homepage reorganization) with objectives, key changes, and commit SHAs. (3) Resolve the Sprint 449 number collision by assigning PR #20 a distinct identifier. Additionally, complete the two remaining 19th audit recommendations (HttpOnly sprint entry + deferred item closure) that were not acted on this cycle. Total implementation cost: ~20 minutes of documentation. All code is correct and committed — only tracking records are missing.

### Trend Note
Recovery from 19th audit regression. Prior entry (2026-02-27, 19th): 4.2/5.0.
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.7 → 4.7 (flat — A1 remains at 4 for different reasons: prior was HttpOnly plan gap, now is homepage visual work plan gap. A3 dropped from 5 to 4: prior audit top priority partially implemented)
- Task Management: 3/5 → 4/5 (improved — prior cycle had 1/2 sprints bypassing all sub-practices; this cycle has 3/16 with gaps, but 13 SOC 2 + visual polish sprints follow protocol rigorously)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained — surgical implementation, Zero-Storage intact, Oat and Obsidian tokens consistent)
- Overall: 4.2 → 4.6 (improved — returned to Excellent band)

This is the 20th audit. The project has returned to the Excellent band (4.6 >= 4.5) from the Good band (4.2 in 19th). The SOC 2 readiness track (11 sprints) demonstrates the highest compliance-discipline planning in the project's history. The recurring gap is specific and consistent: visual/UI work (homepage reorganization, tool slideshow) bypasses the mandatory directive protocol while backend and compliance work follows it rigorously. This pattern has now persisted across 3 audit cycles (HttpOnly in 19th, homepage work in 20th) without generating a systemic lesson or process correction. The gap is procedural, not substantive — code quality, Zero-Storage compliance, and design mandate adherence remain at peak. The 19th audit's three-part top priority was 1.5/3 implemented (CSRF lesson captured, deferred item partially updated, HttpOnly sprint entry not created).
