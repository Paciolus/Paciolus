## Audit — 2026-02-01 | 🟠 Needs Attention | Overall: 2.9/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 2.8   |
| Task Management         | 2/5   |
| Core Principles         | 4/5   |
| **Overall**             | **2.9** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 2/5
**Finding:** No `tasks/todo.md` exists. No evidence of written plans before implementation. The CLAUDE.md defines a "Conflict Loop" process but no plan artifacts demonstrate its use.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/todo.md` and document plans with checkable items before starting each directive.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 5 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, project-auditor). Each has a single purpose. The IntegratorLead protocol in CLAUDE.md shows clear intent to use them.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider adding invocation logs to track actual agent usage.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 1/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` does not exist. No evidence of captured learnings or corrections.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/lessons.md` immediately. After any correction or mistake, document the pattern.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 3/5
**Finding:** Test data generator created and run. Progress indicators added. However, no formal test suite exists and no evidence of end-to-end verification runs.
**Recommendation:** Add automated verification commands. Run after each major change.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 4/5
**Finding:** No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Code is clean with clear separation. StreamingAuditor class well-architected. No over-engineering.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 3/5
**Finding:** No git history to evaluate. No failing tests visible. Code appears functional but untested in production.
**Recommendation:** Initialize git repository and commit changes to enable tracking.

### B. Task Management — 2/5
**Finding:** `tasks/todo.md` does not exist. No checkable items, progress tracking, or review sections. Directive→implementation flow exists in conversation but not documented.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/` directory with `todo.md`. Document plans before coding, track progress, add reviews.

### C. Core Principles — 4/5
**Finding:** Changes are surgical and focused. No dead code, temp fixes, or commented-out blocks. Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-storage policy well-enforced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Create `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` immediately.** The code quality is solid (4/5 on Core Principles), but the workflow infrastructure is missing. Without task tracking artifacts, learnings are lost between sessions and verification is ad-hoc.

### Trend Note
First audit — no prior baseline.

## Audit — 2026-02-04 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 4.7/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.5   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.7** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Excellent plan artifacts. `tasks/todo.md` contains 24 sprints with detailed plans before implementation. Each sprint includes affirmations, constraints, agent assignments, and checkable items. Plans are written before coding (see Sprint 24 checklist created before Dockerfiles). Evidence of re-planning: Sprint 18's "Diagnostic Fidelity" renamed terminology project-wide.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The sprint-based planning with agent assignments is exemplary.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 6 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor). Each has single purpose. Clear evidence of usage: todo.md assigns agents per task (e.g., "BackendCritic: Containerization"). Designer agent created marketing components in Sprint 23.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider logging agent invocations for metrics.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` is comprehensive with 20+ documented lessons spanning Sprints 8-24. Lessons follow the prescribed format with Trigger/Pattern/Example structure. Real corrections captured: "datetime.utcnow() is Deprecated", "framer-motion Type Assertions (Recurring)", "Multi-Stage Docker Builds". Evidence lessons are reviewed: recurring patterns noted across sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The lesson documentation is thorough.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 4/5
**Finding:** Frontend build verification performed (`npm run build`) after major changes. Test suite exists in `backend/tests/`. Review sections added to each sprint in todo.md with "Zero-Storage Verified" checkpoints. However, no evidence of automated CI/CD runs or test execution in recent sprints.
**Recommendation:** Consider adding automated test execution to sprint completion checklist.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code is clean with professional architecture. No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Clear separation of concerns (audit_engine, ratio_engine, flux_engine, recon_engine). Zero-Storage architecture consistently enforced. Multi-stage Docker builds demonstrate production-grade thinking. No over-engineering—components are appropriately sized.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 4/5
**Finding:** Sprint 23 autonomously identified and fixed two type errors (Industry type mismatch, framer-motion type assertion) discovered during build. Fixes documented in lessons.md and todo.md Review section. Limited git history (only 3 commits visible) restricts full evaluation.
**Recommendation:** Commit more frequently to enable better tracking. Consider atomic commits per feature.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** Exemplary task management. All 6 sub-practices present:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint has checkable items before implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Affirmations and constraints documented per sprint
3. **Track Progress** — Items marked complete incrementally (visible checkboxes)
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections explain architectural decisions
5. **Document Results** — Review sections with "Files Created/Modified" lists
6. **Capture Lessons** — lessons.md updated after each sprint

Quick Reference table tracks all 24 sprints. Evidence of cadence matching implementation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. This is the gold standard for task tracking.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Changes are surgical. Sprint 24's Dockerfile is minimal (slim images, no bloat).
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed. Sprint 23 fixed type errors at source, not with workarounds.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes only touch necessary files. Clear file lists in Review sections show focused changes.

Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-Storage architecture enforced at every layer (documented in DEPLOYMENT.md). IP documentation in dev-log.md demonstrates professional-grade due diligence.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Increase commit frequency.** With only 3 commits in git history for 24 sprints of work, the git log doesn't reflect the actual development cadence. Consider atomic commits after each sprint completion to build a proper history trail.

### Trend Note
**Dramatic improvement from prior audit:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 2.8 → 4.5 (+1.7)
- Task Management: 2/5 → 5/5 (+3)
- Core Principles: 4/5 → 5/5 (+1)
- Overall: 2.9 → 4.7 (+1.8)

All gaps identified in the first audit have been addressed:
- ✅ `tasks/todo.md` created and extensively used (was missing)
- ✅ `tasks/lessons.md` created with 20+ documented patterns (was missing)
- ✅ Git repository initialized with commits (was missing)
- ✅ Review sections added to every sprint (was missing)
- ✅ Verification checkpoints documented (was ad-hoc)

## Audit — 2026-02-04 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Exceptional planning discipline. `tasks/todo.md` now tracks 40 sprints (Sprints 1-40 across Phase I, II, and III). Every sprint follows the established pattern: Agent Lead assignments, checkable items before implementation, Review sections after completion. Sprints 36-40 demonstrate consistent plan→execute cadence with atomic commits per sprint.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The sprint-based planning is mature and well-maintained.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure expanded. `.claude/agents/` contains `accounting-expert-auditor` and `project-auditor.md`. Clear evidence of agent usage: todo.md assigns agents per sprint (BackendCritic, FrontendExecutor, FintechDesigner, QualityGuardian). Recent sprints show multi-agent collaboration (e.g., Sprint 39: "FintechDesigner + FrontendExecutor"). Agent specialization is clear and focused.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider documenting agent collaboration patterns.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` remains comprehensive with 20+ documented lessons. Lessons continue to follow Trigger/Pattern/Example format. Evidence of review: recurring patterns (framer-motion types) identified and prevented. The lessons file is actively consulted—similar issues don't recur in recent sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Major improvement from prior audit. Frontend build verification (`npm run build`) executed after every sprint. Backend test suite now at 225 tests. Review sections consistently note "Zero-Storage Verified". Most importantly: **commit frequency now matches sprint cadence**. Git log shows 20 recent commits with atomic sprint-based messages (Sprint 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 all have individual commits).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The commit discipline gap from the prior audit has been fully addressed.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code architecture continues to demonstrate professional quality. Recent additions (BatchUploadContext, RollingWindowAnalyzer, IndustryRatioCalculators) follow established patterns. RFC documents (`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`) show thoughtful design with schema definitions, data source analysis, and implementation roadmaps. No shortcuts or hacky solutions. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The RFC approach for Phase III is excellent.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Self-contained bug fixes visible in git history. Recent sprints show autonomous resolution of TypeScript errors during build verification. No evidence of incomplete fixes or back-and-forth patches. Build passes after every sprint without manual intervention.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** Exemplary task management continues. All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint has checkable items before implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Agent assignments and constraints documented
3. **Track Progress** — Items marked complete incrementally
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections explain decisions
5. **Document Results** — Files Created/Modified lists included
6. **Capture Lessons** — lessons.md updated as needed

Phase II (Sprints 25-39) and Phase III (Sprint 40+) maintain the same discipline established earlier.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Changes remain surgical. Sprint 40's RFC is comprehensive but focused.
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed. No temporary fixes visible.
- **Minimal Impact:** Each sprint's git diff shows focused file changes.

Recent additions (batch upload, rolling window, industry ratios, benchmark RFC) demonstrate continued professional quality. Type hints, docstrings, and Zero-Storage compliance maintained throughout.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Maintain current discipline while scaling Phase III.** The workflow infrastructure is now mature. As benchmark implementation begins (Sprints 41-47), continue the sprint-based planning with atomic commits. Consider adding integration tests for the new benchmark comparison features.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score achieved:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.5 → 5.0 (+0.5)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 4.7 → 5.0 (+0.3)

Key improvement from prior audit:
- ✅ **Commit frequency increased** — 20 commits now visible (was 3)
- ✅ **Sprint cadence matches commits** — Each sprint has atomic commit
- ✅ **Verification before done** — A4 score improved from 4/5 to 5/5

The primary recommendation from the prior audit ("Increase commit frequency") has been fully addressed. Sprints 36-40 each have their own commit with descriptive messages.

## Audit — 2026-02-05 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 was fully planned before implementation. The plan was structured with backend and frontend sections, implementation order, endpoint classification tables, and verification criteria. `tasks/todo.md` was updated at directive start with 10 checkable items, all marked as the sprint progressed. The plan distinguished between endpoints to protect (audit/export), endpoints to upgrade (require_current_user → require_verified_user), and endpoints to leave alone (client/user/settings/reference data). This level of classification before coding prevented scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure stable at 7 agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor). Sprint 59's todo.md assigns "BackendCritic + FrontendExecutor" as agent leads. The Agent Council process continues to drive sprint prioritization — Sprint 59's endpoint classification (audit vs client vs reference) reflects the kind of nuanced decision-making the council protocol enables.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` remains active with 20+ structured lessons. Sprint 59 learnings were captured in MEMORY.md with 6 specific patterns: endpoint classification, DEV MOCK removal, structured error detail handling, guest CTA pattern, pre-check pattern, and auth header pattern. These are actionable, concrete, and formatted consistently. The DEV MOCK removal lesson is particularly valuable — it documents a development-to-production transition pattern.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 verification was thorough: `pytest` run (626 passed, 1 pre-existing perf flake identified and correctly excluded), `npm run build` passed with zero errors, and specific test suites verified (32 benchmark API tests confirmed override changes work). The commit message accurately reflects the 8 files changed. The pre-existing performance test flake was correctly identified as unrelated rather than hidden.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 demonstrates excellent surgical precision. The diff is -388/+179 lines — a net reduction. The guest diagnostic zone (300+ lines of duplicated audit UI) was replaced with a 40-line sign-in CTA card. Auth header injection uses a clean spread pattern (`...(token ? { 'Authorization': ... } : {})`). Error handling for structured `detail` objects uses a consistent pattern across 3 files (apiClient.ts, DownloadReportButton.tsx, ExportOptionsPanel.tsx). No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments found. No over-engineering — the pre-check in `handleFileUpload` is a single `if` statement, not an abstraction.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 identified and resolved the `[object Object]` error display issue proactively — the structured `detail` from `require_verified_user` would have rendered as `[object Object]` in the UI without the fix to `apiClient.ts`. This was caught during planning, not after a user report. The DEV MOCK removal was also handled autonomously with understanding of its downstream effects (auth flow now works end-to-end). No incomplete fixes or back-and-forth visible in the commit.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Sprint 59 plan written to todo.md with 10 checkable items before any code
2. **Verify Plan** — Endpoint classification table reviewed before implementation
3. **Track Progress** — Items checked off incrementally (8 task tracker items progressed through pending → in_progress → completed)
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit message lists all changes with rationale
5. **Document Results** — todo.md updated with COMPLETE status
6. **Capture Lessons** — MEMORY.md updated with 6 Sprint 59 patterns

Git log now shows 20 sprints with atomic commits (Sprints 41-59), each with descriptive messages.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Net code reduction (-209 lines). Guest diagnostic zone replaced with clean CTA. Auth header pattern reused consistently across files.
- **No Laziness:** Root cause addressed for error display (`[object Object]`). DEV MOCK properly removed instead of worked around. All 19 endpoints classified and handled appropriately.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes only touch Sprint 59 files. Pre-existing portfolio changes (EditClientModal) correctly excluded from the commit. Reference data endpoints correctly left public.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat & Obsidian design tokens used in the sign-in CTA card. No generic Tailwind colors.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Continue scaling Phase V with Sprint 60 (Homepage Demo Mode).** The auth gating infrastructure is now complete. The guest view currently shows a static sign-in CTA — Sprint 60 should add an interactive demo with synthetic data to demonstrate value before requiring sign-up. This is a marketing/conversion optimization, not a technical debt item.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 3 consecutive audits:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Project has grown to 626 backend tests + 26 frontend tests (652 total)
- Git history now spans 20 atomic sprint commits (41-59)
- Sprint 59 achieved a net code reduction while adding security features — a sign of mature architecture
- The DEV MOCK → real auth transition is a significant production readiness milestone

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 60 was fully planned before implementation. The plan included a detailed "Demo Narrative" specifying exact data ($5.2M TB, 42 accounts, 3 anomalies, 9 ratios, 8 lead sheets), new file specifications with type imports and component interfaces, modification instructions with exact line references, implementation order (6 steps), and 9 verification criteria. `tasks/todo.md` was updated with 7 checkable items, all marked complete. The plan correctly identified the need for `disabled={true}` props and no-op callbacks.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure stable at 7 agents. Explore subagent used effectively for parallel file reading — 9 files read simultaneously (types, components, hooks, fixtures) to gather type definitions before implementation. This prevented multiple sequential reads and kept the main context clean. Sprint 60 assigned to "FrontendExecutor + FintechDesigner" following the established Agent Council pattern.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** Two new lessons captured in `tasks/lessons.md` from real build errors:
1. **Severity type mismatch** — Frontend `Severity` is `'high' | 'low'` only, not `'medium'`. Documented the cross-stack type discrepancy.
2. **framer-motion ease typing** — `as const` required when extracting variants to module-level consts. Referenced the existing pattern in `ProcessTimeline.tsx`.

MEMORY.md updated with 7 Sprint 60 patterns including the DSO dynamic key workaround and whileInView viewport trigger. Lessons are actionable and reference existing codebase patterns.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** `npm run build` was run 3 times during Sprint 60:
1. First run: TypeScript error on `ease: 'easeOut'` — fixed with `as const`
2. Second run: TypeScript error on `severity: 'medium'` — fixed to `'high'`/`'low'`
3. Third run: Zero errors, build passed

Commit verified via `git show --stat HEAD` — confirmed only 6 Sprint 60 files included (portfolio changes from a prior sprint correctly excluded). Risk summary counts updated to match severity changes.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 60 demonstrates excellent component reuse. DemoZone renders 4 existing components (RiskDashboard, KeyMetricsSection, BenchmarkSection, LeadSheetSection) with `disabled={true}` rather than reimplementing demo-specific UI. Data separated cleanly into `demoData.ts` (451 lines of typed constants) and presentation into `DemoZone.tsx` (201 lines). The page.tsx change is a net reduction: 46 lines of CTA HTML replaced with a single `<DemoZone />` tag. No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. No over-engineering — the demo data follows the existing test fixture pattern exactly.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Two TypeScript build errors encountered and resolved autonomously:
1. `Severity` type mismatch: `'medium'` is not a valid frontend severity value. Root cause understood (backend uses medium severity in risk_summary counts, but individual anomaly severity is only high/low). Fixed data to use `'high'` for material anomalies and updated risk_summary counts accordingly.
2. framer-motion ease typing: Recognized that inline JSX infers literal types but module-level consts don't. Applied `as const` pattern already established in `ProcessTimeline.tsx`.

Both fixes were self-contained with no user involvement. No incomplete fixes or workarounds.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Sprint 60 plan written to todo.md with 7 checkable items before coding
2. **Verify Plan** — Component interfaces, type imports, and data schema specified upfront
3. **Track Progress** — 4 task tracker items progressed through pending → in_progress → completed
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit message describes the feature and its purpose
5. **Document Results** — todo.md updated with COMPLETE status and detailed checklist
6. **Capture Lessons** — 2 lessons in lessons.md + 7 patterns in MEMORY.md

Git log now shows 21 atomic sprint commits (Sprints 41-60).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** DemoZone reuses 4 existing components instead of building demo-specific UI. Data constants follow the existing fixture pattern. Page.tsx simplified by replacing 46 lines with 2 lines.
- **No Laziness:** Type errors addressed at the root (understanding frontend vs backend type discrepancies). DSO added via dynamic key access with clear comment explaining why. No shortcuts.
- **Minimal Impact:** Only 6 files in the commit. Portfolio changes correctly excluded. No modifications to existing component interfaces — all components already supported `disabled` prop.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained (hardcoded constants only, no API calls in demo). Oat & Obsidian design tokens used throughout — sage for success/CTA, obsidian for backgrounds, oatmeal for text. Font hierarchy correct (serif for headers, sans for body, mono for financial numbers).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Begin Phase V planning.** Sprint 60 completes the homepage experience — guests now see an interactive demo instead of a static sign-in card. The next priority should be determined by Agent Council consensus, likely focusing on either: (a) frontend test expansion for the new DemoZone/demo data, (b) portfolio UX completion (EditClientModal is uncommitted), or (c) a new Phase V feature based on user feedback.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 4 consecutive audits (2nd audit today):**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Sprint 60 is the recommended follow-up from the prior audit's "Top Priority" (Homepage Demo Mode)
- DemoZone demonstrates mature component architecture — 4 existing components reused with zero modifications
- Two build errors caught and fixed during implementation, both documented as lessons
- Project now has 21 atomic sprint commits in git history

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase VI completed with all 10 sprints (61-70) planned before implementation and executed in order. Sprint 70 (Diagnostic Zone Protection + Phase VI Wrap) was the final sprint, planned with 7 checkable items in `tasks/todo.md`, all marked complete. Phase VII has been fully planned with 10 sprints (71-80), detailed checklist items per sprint, agent assignments, file-level specifications, and estimated test counts — all documented before a single line of implementation code. The Phase VII plan includes a "Not Currently Pursuing" section with 15 features and rationale, demonstrating disciplined scope control. The council review process (Agent Council + CEO approval) was followed before committing the plan.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The Phase VII plan with per-agent action items and file-level specs is the most detailed plan produced yet.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure expanded to 8 agents in `.claude/agents/`: critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, and the newly added future-state-consultant-agent. The Future State Consultant produced a 20-feature catalog that was evaluated against existing infrastructure by the Agent Council — 3 features identified as already built, 2 substantially built, 4 high leverage. This demonstrates agents producing real analytical output, not just being defined. Sprint assignments in Phase VII continue multi-agent collaboration (e.g., "BackendCritic + QualityGuardian" for Sprint 74). The Phase VI close-out was executed by QualityGuardian lead, consistent with its wrap/protection role.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The future-state-consultant-agent → council evaluation → CEO decision workflow is an excellent pattern for strategic planning.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` now has 25+ lessons spanning Sprints 8-70. The Phase VI retrospective captures two critical architectural patterns: (1) "Frontend auth gating must be 3-state, not 2-state" — distinguishing guest/unverified/verified, and (2) "Wrap-up sprints catch inconsistencies across features built over multiple sprints." Earlier lessons continue to be applied — the `as const` pattern for framer-motion (first documented Sprint 23) was consistently applied in Sprint 66-69 frontend work. The CSPRNG lesson (Sprint 69) documents a regulatory compliance pattern (PCAOB AS 2315) that goes beyond typical development practices.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Exceptional verification this cycle. The previously skipped test (`test_failed_login_returns_lockout_info`) was identified, fully implemented, and passes — moving from 1022 passed/1 skipped to 1023 passed/0 skipped. `npm run build` passes with 20 routes. Backend `pytest` runs clean. Sprint 70 commit touches exactly the files listed in the review section (6 files, +102/-21 lines). The Phase VI close-out commit is surgical (3 files, +39/-13 lines). The skipped test was not ignored or deleted — it was implemented as a proper integration test with user registration, failed login, and lockout info assertion.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The "zero skipped tests" achievement is notable.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code quality remains high. Zero HACK/FIXME comments in the entire codebase (backend + frontend). Only 3 TODO comments exist in frontend — all in non-critical areas (activity log dates, terms/privacy modals). Sprint 70's verification gate follows the exact same pattern established in JE Testing (Sprint 66), demonstrating consistency. The 3-state auth pattern (`isVerified = user?.is_verified !== false`) is a single line that enables the ternary — no over-engineering. The deferred items cleanup deleted 4 stale items that were actually shipped features, showing honesty about what's done vs. what's planned.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** The skipped test investigation and fix was entirely autonomous. The auditor identified `test_failed_login_returns_lockout_info` as empty with `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="bcrypt compatibility")`, investigated the root cause (harmless passlib warning, not an actual failure), implemented the full integration test (register user → fail login → assert lockout info), and removed the skip decorator. No user involvement required. The JSX fragment wrapping issue in Sprint 70 (multiple siblings in ternary else branch) was also caught and fixed during implementation without escalation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained at the highest level:
1. **Plan First** — Sprint 70 planned with 7 items before implementation; Phase VII planned with 10 sprints and 100+ items before any code
2. **Verify Plan** — Agent Council consulted for Phase VII prioritization; Future State Consultant features evaluated against existing codebase
3. **Track Progress** — Items checked incrementally across Sprint 70 and close-out tasks
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit messages descriptive: "Sprint 70: Diagnostic Zone Protection + Phase VI Wrap", "Phase VI close-out: fix skipped test, clean deferred items"
5. **Document Results** — Sprint 70 review section lists all 6 modified files with descriptions
6. **Capture Lessons** — Phase VI retrospective with 2 key patterns; 10 lessons added across Phase VI

Git log shows 30+ atomic sprint commits. Phase VII plan includes a "Not Currently Pursuing" log with 15 features and rationale — demonstrating not just what's planned but what's deliberately excluded and why.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Sprint 70 adds verification gates with a single `const isVerified` + ternary pattern. No new abstractions, no shared verification component — just the same pattern repeated in 2 files (JE Testing already had it). The close-out commit is +39/-13 lines for a test implementation + deferred item cleanup.
- **No Laziness:** Skipped test was not ignored or deleted — it was fully implemented. Stale deferred items were not left to accumulate — they were evaluated by council and cleaned up. Phase VII plan required deep research into 20 features against the existing codebase before prioritization.
- **Minimal Impact:** Sprint 70 touches only 6 files. Close-out touches only 3 files. Phase VII planning touches only 3 files (agent spec, CLAUDE.md, todo.md). No unrelated changes mixed into commits.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat & Obsidian design tokens used in new UI elements (clay-500 for lock icon, oatmeal-200/400/500 for text, obsidian-800/600 for backgrounds).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Execute Sprint 71: Financial Statements — Backend Builder + Export.** The Phase VII plan is comprehensive and ready. Sprint 71 has 85% reuse potential from existing lead sheet mapping and ratio engine. The key deliverable is `financial_statement_builder.py` (~200 lines) that transforms existing `lead_sheet_grouping` + `category_totals` into formatted Balance Sheet and Income Statement structures. This is the highest-leverage sprint in Phase VII — it adds a visible capability to Tool 1 with minimal new code.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 6 consecutive audits (3rd audit today):**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Phase VI fully completed: 10 sprints (61-70) delivering 2 new tools (Multi-Period, JE Testing) + platform rebrand
- Test count: 1023 backend + 26 frontend (1049 total) with zero skipped — up from 625 + 26 at Phase V end
- Skipped test identified, investigated, and fixed autonomously (1 skip → 0 skips)
- Deferred items audited: 4 deleted (stale/shipped), 1 retained (Multi-Currency)
- Phase VII fully planned with 10 sprints, per-agent actions, and a 15-item "Not Pursuing" log
- 8 agents now in `.claude/agents/` (future-state-consultant-agent added)
- Project version: 0.60.0

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.8   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.9** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase VII (Sprints 71-80) was fully planned before implementation with per-sprint complexity scores, agent lead assignments, file-level specifications, and estimated test counts. All 10 sprints executed in order with plan→implement→verify cadence. Sprints 81-82 (code quality refactoring) were also planned before execution with explicit trigger documentation ("Codebase audit identified 3 immediate-priority issues"). The "Not Currently Pursuing" log (15 features with rationale) demonstrates disciplined scope control. Phase VIII candidates shortlisted for future evaluation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** 8 well-defined agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, future-state-consultant-agent). Each has a single focused purpose. Evidence of active use: todo.md assigns multi-agent collaboration per sprint (e.g., "BackendCritic + QualityGuardian" for Sprint 74, "FrontendExecutor + FintechDesigner" for Sprint 76). The Future State Consultant's 20-feature catalog drove Phase VII prioritization. Agent specialization boundaries are clear — no bloated multi-purpose agents.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` now has 30+ lessons spanning Sprints 8-82. Three new lessons added since last audit: (1) Phase VII Retrospective documenting "Navigation consistency requires a dedicated wrap-up sprint" and "Leverage-first feature selection works", (2) "Extract Shared Components Early, Not Late" (Sprint 81) documenting the ToolNav/useFileUpload extraction and session TTL pattern, (3) "Three Layers of DRY" (Sprint 82) documenting the Rule of Three for utility extraction and generic hook config patterns. Lessons are actionable, include concrete examples, and reference specific sprint numbers. Evidence that lessons are applied: the `useAuditUpload` generic hook pattern in Sprint 82 directly addresses the duplication documented in earlier lessons.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Every sprint in Phase VII has explicit verification notes: `pytest` test counts (1,050 → 1,215 → 1,270 across the phase), `npm run build` pass confirmations with route counts (20 → 21 → 22), and Zero-Storage compliance checks. Sprint 81 verified with targeted `pytest tests/test_adjusting_entries.py` (45 tests) for session TTL changes. Sprint 82 verified with targeted tests across 4 test files (533 tests) plus full `pytest` (1,270 tests). Git commits are atomic per sprint with descriptive messages matching the sprint naming convention.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 4/5
**Finding:** Code quality is high. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in backend (Python). Only 3 TODO comments remain in frontend — all pre-existing in non-critical areas (activity log dates, terms/privacy modals). Sprint 82's `useAuditUpload` generic hook is well-designed — config object pattern, type-safe generics, single responsibility. `downloadBlob` utility is clean (30 lines, focused). Backend `shared/helpers.py` extractions (`parse_uploaded_file`, `parse_json_mapping`, `safe_download_filename`) are appropriately sized. **Minor gap:** Sprint 82 work (16 modified files, 2 new files) is complete and verified but remains uncommitted. The working tree has been sitting with uncommitted changes across backend + frontend, which creates risk of accidental loss or merge conflicts. The `options` object in `useAuditUpload` is passed to `useCallback` as a dependency — since it's memoized with `useMemo` in the wrapper, this works, but the pattern creates a subtle referential stability coupling between the wrapper and the generic hook.
**Recommendation:** Commit Sprint 82 work immediately. The uncommitted state across 18 files is an unnecessary risk for a refactoring sprint that's been verified.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 81 autonomously identified and resolved three code quality issues from a codebase audit: duplicated navigation (300+ lines → 1 component), duplicated drag/drop (78 lines → 1 hook), and a production-risk memory leak (session storage with no TTL/eviction). Sprint 82 autonomously identified and resolved duplicated file parsing, blob downloads, and auth error handling across 5 backend routes and 5 frontend hooks/pages. No user escalation required for any fix. All fixes were self-contained with no regressions (1,270 backend tests + 22 frontend routes verified).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained at the highest level:
1. **Plan First** — Sprints 71-82 all have checkable items in todo.md before implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Agent Council consulted for Phase VII planning; complexity scores assigned upfront
3. **Track Progress** — Items checked incrementally across all sprints; Phase VII summary table shows 10/10 COMPLETE
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections list Files Created/Modified with line counts and descriptions
5. **Document Results** — Sprint 80 wrap-up includes complete file modification list; Sprint 81-82 have detailed reviews
6. **Capture Lessons** — 3 new lessons added (Phase VII retro + 2 code quality patterns)

Git log shows 20 atomic sprint commits visible in the last 20 entries, all following the `Sprint X: Brief Description` convention. The todo.md file now tracks 82 sprints across 7 phases with consistent structure.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Sprint 81 is a net code reduction (ToolNav replaces ~300 lines of duplicated nav with 65 lines). Sprint 82 reduces 3 domain hooks from ~92 lines each to ~35 lines each by extracting the generic `useAuditUpload`. Backend helpers are 3 focused functions (10-15 lines each) replacing scattered inline code across 5 route files. No over-engineering — utilities are appropriately scoped.
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed in Sprint 81 (session memory leak fixed with TTL + LRU eviction, not just documented). Sprint 82 eliminated import duplication at the source (5 route files no longer import io, json, pandas individually). The `parseResult: (data: unknown) => data as APTestingResult` pattern in wrapper hooks is a pragmatic cast, not a lazy shortcut — the API response shape is validated by the backend.
- **Minimal Impact:** Sprint 81 touched 8 frontend files + 1 backend file. Sprint 82 touched 13 files (5 backend routes + 1 shared helper + 3 frontend pages + 3 hooks + 1 index). Both are pure refactoring — no behavioral changes, no API modifications, no new features mixed in.

Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in backend. Oat & Obsidian design tokens used consistently across all 5 tool pages. Zero-Storage compliance maintained.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Commit Sprint 82 and begin Phase VIII planning.** Sprint 82's refactoring work (18 files: 6 backend, 10 frontend, 2 task files) has been verified (`npm run build` clean, `pytest` 1,270 pass) but sits uncommitted. This is the only workflow gap — commit it to lock in the improvements and clear the working tree for Phase VIII. Then convene the Agent Council to evaluate the 5 Phase VIII candidates (Ghost Employee Detector, Expense Classification Validator, Cash Flow Statement, Three-Way Match Validator, Intercompany Elimination Checker).

### Trend Note
**Near-perfect score after 7 consecutive audits:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 4.8 (-0.2) — minor dip due to uncommitted Sprint 82 work
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 4.9 (-0.1)

The 0.1-point dip is entirely attributable to the uncommitted Sprint 82 changes (A5 scored 4/5 instead of 5/5). The code quality itself is excellent — the issue is purely the uncommitted state. Once committed, all pillars would return to 5/5.

Notable observations this cycle:
- Phase VII fully completed: 10 sprints (71-80) delivering Financial Statements + AP Testing + Bank Reconciliation
- 2 additional code quality sprints (81-82) extracted shared components and utilities
- Test count: 1,270 backend + 26 frontend (1,296 total) — up from 1,023 + 26 at Phase VI end
- Net code reduction across Sprints 81-82 despite adding shared components (extraction > duplication)
- lessons.md now has 30+ entries spanning 82 sprints — a mature institutional knowledge base
- Project version: 0.70.0 (Phase VII shipped)

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Exceptional planning discipline continues. Phase XII (Sprints 111-120) was fully planned before implementation with per-sprint complexity scores, agent lead assignments, and detailed checklists. Phase XIII has been planned with 10 sprints (121-130), each with granular checkable items derived from a rigorous 4-agent product review (51 findings synthesized). The Phase XIII plan includes explicit design principles ("The Vault Interior" dual-theme), P0-P3 priority mapping from review findings to sprint items, and a comprehensive exclusions table with deferral rationale. The planning for Phase XIII demonstrates a new maturity: evidence-driven planning where independent review agents identified gaps that were then triaged into sprints by severity.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The product-review-driven planning is the most rigorous planning approach yet.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure at 8 agents in `.claude/agents/`. This audit cycle saw the most sophisticated multi-agent collaboration to date: 4 independent review agents (backend architecture, product completeness, 2 frontend design) ran in parallel, producing 51 combined findings. Findings were synthesized into a unified P0-P3 prioritized report, then a FintechDesigner agent produced "The Vault Interior" design specification, and a Scope Auditor agent quantified the migration scope (~2,867 class occurrences across ~123 files). This represents subagents being used not just for task execution but for strategic product assessment — a higher-order application of the pattern.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The multi-agent product review pattern should be documented in lessons.md as a reusable workflow.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` now has 50+ lessons spanning Sprints 8-120 (566 lines). Phase XII added 6 new lessons: nav overflow patterns, comment model design, assignment model patterns, fixed asset engine derivation, memo generator patterns, and inventory engine replication. The lessons demonstrate institutional memory — Sprint 119 references Sprint 116 patterns, Sprint 117 references Sprint 114 patterns, showing that prior lessons inform new implementation. MEMORY.md was also updated with Phase XIII design patterns (dual-theme architecture, product review findings). The memory system is serving its purpose: knowledge compounds across phases.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase XII verification was thorough across all 10 sprints. Sprint 120 (Phase XII Wrap) ran full backend regression (2,515 tests passed, 0 failures), full frontend build (29 routes), all 6 AccountingExpertAuditor guardrails, and FA + Inventory memo compliance review. Every sprint in Phase XII has an atomic commit with a descriptive message matching the sprint naming convention. The commit cadence exactly mirrors the sprint sequence (111-120, no gaps). The uncommitted changes in the working tree are exclusively planning/documentation artifacts for Phase XIII (CLAUDE.md, todo.md, archive file, audit-journal.md) — not application code, so there is no verification gap.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Commit the Phase XIII planning artifacts to lock in the documentation.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code quality remains high. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in all Python backend code. Only 3 pre-existing TODOs in frontend (terms/privacy modals, audit date) — unchanged since Phase V. Sprint 120 is a pure verification sprint with zero application code changes. The prior sprints (111-119) demonstrate consistent patterns: each new tool (Fixed Assets, Inventory) follows an established engine→route→memo→frontend pipeline. The product review identified no architectural issues in the backend — all 19 backend findings were operational (rate limiting, upload validation, version strings) rather than structural. The Phase XIII todo reflects disciplined scoping: 8 explicit exclusions with rationale, 13 deferred items with phase assignments.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase XII demonstrates consistent autonomous resolution. Sprint 117 caught a Python syntax error (leading zero `07` in date literal) during implementation and fixed it immediately. The product review itself was an autonomous initiative — 4 agents independently identified issues without user prompting for specific areas. All Phase XII sprints show self-contained commits with no back-and-forth patches or incomplete fixes. No failing tests in the repository. No regressions introduced across the 10-sprint phase.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained at the highest level:
1. **Plan First** — Phase XIII fully planned with 10 sprints and 100+ checkable items before any implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Agent Council + 4-agent product review + FintechDesigner spec consulted before sprint definition
3. **Track Progress** — All Phase XII sprints marked COMPLETE with sequential progress
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit messages are descriptive: "Sprint 120: Phase XII Wrap — Regression + v1.1.0" with bullet-point details
5. **Document Results** — todo.md compressed from 1,117 to 517 lines by archiving Phases X-XII to `tasks/archive/phases-x-xii-details.md` (410 lines) — maintaining history while reducing active file size
6. **Capture Lessons** — 6 new lessons added across Phase XII; MEMORY.md updated with Phase XIII patterns

The archive strategy (Phases VI-IX in one file, Phases X-XII in another) demonstrates maturing documentation practices — active plans stay concise while history is preserved and accessible.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Phase XII tools (Fixed Assets, Inventory) follow established patterns exactly. Sprint 115-120 lessons explicitly note "5-minute copy-and-customize" for memo generators and "fully templatable" for frontend pages. No new abstractions or frameworks introduced — just disciplined reuse of existing patterns.
- **No Laziness:** The product review (51 findings) was conducted voluntarily before Phase XIII, not in response to failures. P0 issues identified (broken Tailwind scales, stale versions) were immediately prioritized into Sprint 121. The todo.md compression (1,117 → 517 lines) was a proactive cleanup, not a reactive fix.
- **Minimal Impact:** Sprint 120 touches only 3 documentation files. Phase XII commits are surgical — each sprint's diff corresponds exactly to its described scope.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat & Obsidian design tokens used consistently across all 11 tool pages. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in backend.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Execute Sprint 121 to fix P0 Tailwind config issues.** The product review identified that `oatmeal-600` through `oatmeal-900` (and clay-800/900, sage-800/900) are used in 74 files but undefined in `tailwind.config.ts` — meaning those classes silently produce no CSS output. This is the highest-impact fix because it affects the visual correctness of the existing product before any new theme work begins. Sprint 121 also addresses stale version strings (3 files show versions from Phases III/IX/X) and 3 amber-* design mandate violations.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score restored after 7th consecutive audit in the Excellent band:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.8 → 5.0 (+0.2)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 4.9 → 5.0 (+0.1)

The 0.1-point dip from the prior audit (Sprint 82 uncommitted changes) has been resolved — all Phase XII work is committed. Current uncommitted changes are exclusively Phase XIII planning artifacts (documentation only, no application code).

Notable observations this cycle:
- Phase XII fully completed: 10 sprints (111-120) delivering Collaboration Layer + Fixed Asset Testing + Inventory Testing
- Test count: 2,515 backend + 76 frontend (2,591 total) — up from ~2,114 at Phase XI end (+401 new tests)
- 4-agent product review conducted: 51 findings triaged into Phase XIII sprints by severity
- "The Vault Interior" dual-theme design specified and approved, ready for implementation
- todo.md compressed 54% (1,117 → 517 lines) while preserving full history in archives
- lessons.md reached 50+ entries across 120 sprints — mature institutional knowledge base
- Project version: 1.1.0 (Phase XII shipped), targeting 1.2.0 (Phase XIII)

| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase XV (Code Deduplication) was planned before implementation using a dedicated Plan agent that analyzed the codebase and produced a 6-sprint plan with explicit scope, file lists, risk assessments, and a "What We're NOT Doing" section (4 intentional exclusions with rationale). The plan was written to a plan file and submitted for CEO approval before any code was touched. Each sprint (136-141) had defined deliverables, verification criteria, and dependency ordering. The plan correctly identified that route template consolidation and hook consolidation should NOT be pursued despite superficial duplication — demonstrating judgment about when extraction helps vs. when it over-abstracts.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The plan-mode-with-exclusions pattern is exemplary.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase XV made extensive use of parallel subagents. Sprint 136 used 3 parallel agents to update 9 engine files simultaneously (AP+Payroll+Revenue, FA+Inventory+AR, JE+BankRec+TWM). Sprints 139 and 140 were executed as parallel agents (ScoreCard+TestResultGrid and FlaggedTable running simultaneously). The initial codebase review used 4 parallel Explore agents (structure mapping, backend audit, frontend audit, conventions check). Each agent had a focused scope and returned actionable results. This is the most agent-parallel sprint in the project's history — 6+ concurrent agents used effectively.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The parallel-agent pattern for uniform refactoring is a reusable workflow worth documenting.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` now has 55+ lessons spanning Sprints 8-141. Phase XV added a comprehensive retrospective documenting 5 new patterns: (1) "Extract shared utilities AFTER patterns stabilize across 7+ consumers", (2) "Generic TypeScript interfaces handle domain variation via type parameters and ReactNode slots", (3) "Backward-compatible type aliases prevent cascading import changes", (4) "Context directory consolidation is a mechanical mass-rename", (5) "Color drift between tool copies is the hidden cost of cloning". MEMORY.md was updated with new shared component file locations and the `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` path change. Lessons reference specific sprint numbers and concrete code patterns.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Every sprint in Phase XV had explicit verification. Sprint 136: `pytest` (2,593 tests, 0 failures). Sprint 137: `npm run build` pass. Sprint 138: `npm run build` pass. Sprints 139-140: `npm run build` pass from agents, then verified again in main context. Sprint 141: full regression — `npm run build` pass, `npm test` (128/128), `pytest` (2,593 tests, 0 failures). The final commit was verified before pushing. The commit message accurately describes the 126 files changed: "~4,750 lines removed" matches the actual diff (-5,137/+2,311 = net -2,826). Git push verified to remote.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase XV is a masterclass in balanced elegance. The shared components use clean design patterns: `ColumnDef<T>` for FlaggedEntriesTable column config, `BaseCompositeScore<TFinding = string>` generic for Payroll's structured findings, `extra_stats?: ReactNode` slot for AR's unique display. Domain components became thin wrappers (15-67 lines each) that pass domain-specific config to shared components — no over-abstraction. The plan explicitly excluded 4 refactoring targets that appeared duplicated but had meaningful domain variations (route templates, hooks, column detection, Benford's Law). Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in all new and modified code. Net code reduction: 126 files, -5,137/+2,311 lines.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 137 encountered a TypeScript incompatibility: `PayrollCompositeScore.top_findings` was a structured array `{employee, test, issue}[]` that couldn't extend `BaseCompositeScore` with `top_findings: string[]`. The fix was autonomous — `BaseCompositeScore` was made generic: `BaseCompositeScore<TFinding = string>` with Payroll using `BaseCompositeScore<PayrollTopFinding>`. This was caught during build verification, diagnosed, and fixed without user involvement. Sprint 141's context consolidation also handled the 58-file import update cleanly with no regressions.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Phase XV plan written with 6 sprints, per-sprint deliverables, risk assessments, and verification strategy before any implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Plan agent consulted, CEO approved via ExitPlanMode before execution
3. **Track Progress** — Task tracker used with 13 tasks, incrementally marked in_progress → completed
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit message details all 4 categories of changes (backend, frontend types, frontend components, structural)
5. **Document Results** — todo.md updated with Phase XV section including per-sprint file lists and review sections
6. **Capture Lessons** — lessons.md updated with 5 new patterns; MEMORY.md updated with file location changes

Git log shows atomic commit for Phase XV (`0414fd8`) with descriptive message. CLAUDE.md updated to reflect Phase XV COMPLETE status.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Phase XV achieved a net reduction of ~2,826 lines across 126 files. Shared components are appropriately scoped — each handles exactly one concern (quality badge, score card, test grid, flagged table). No framework or factory pattern introduced where simple component composition suffices. Type aliases provide backward compatibility without complex re-export machinery.
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed. Color drift between 7 tool copies was standardized to a single canonical palette in `testingShared.ts`. The `context/` → `contexts/` inconsistency (deferred from Sprint 124) was finally resolved. Backend debris (`nul`, `large_test.csv`) cleaned up. Phase III orphan docs archived properly rather than deleted.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes are purely structural — zero behavioral changes. All 2,593 backend tests pass unchanged. All 128 frontend tests pass unchanged. Domain component APIs are backward compatible (thin wrappers preserve import paths). No new features mixed into the refactoring commit.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK in backend. Oat & Obsidian design tokens standardized across all shared testing components.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Evaluate Phase XVI candidates via Agent Council.** Phase XV was a code health sprint. The platform is now at v1.2.0 with 141 sprints across 15 phases, a deduplicated codebase, and full test coverage. The next phase should be driven by user feedback or market analysis — potential candidates include: Accrual Reasonableness Testing (Tool 12), Multi-Currency Conversion (long-deferred RFC), Budget Variance Deep-Dive, or Onboarding Flow. Run the Agent Council to evaluate candidates against leverage, complexity, and market demand.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 9th audit in the Excellent band:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Phase XV delivered a pure code health sprint: 6 sprints (136-141) focused entirely on deduplication and structural cleanup
- Net impact: 126 files changed, -5,137/+2,311 lines (net -2,826), 5 new shared modules, 35 domain components reduced to thin wrappers
- Most parallel-agent sprint in project history: 3-way engine update parallelism (Sprint 136) + dual-sprint parallelism (Sprints 139/140)
- Test count stable: 2,593 backend + 128 frontend — zero tests broken by refactoring, confirming backward compatibility
- `context/` → `contexts/` consolidation resolved a Sprint 124 deferral (58 import updates, zero regressions)
- Phase III docs properly archived (4 files → `tasks/archive/phase-iii/`)
- lessons.md reached 55+ entries across 141 sprints
- Project version: 1.2.0 (Phase XV complete), 15 phases shipped
