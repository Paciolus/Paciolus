## Audit — 2026-02-01 | 🟠 Needs Attention | Overall: 2.9/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 2.8   |
| Task Management         | 2/5   |
| Core Principles         | 4/5   |
| **Overall**             | **2.9** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 2/5
**Finding:** No `tasks/todo.md` exists. No evidence of written plans before implementation. The CLAUDE.md defines a "Conflict Loop" process but no plan artifacts demonstrate its use.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/todo.md` and document plans with checkable items before starting each directive.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 5 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, project-auditor). Each has a single purpose. The IntegratorLead protocol in CLAUDE.md shows clear intent to use them.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider adding invocation logs to track actual agent usage.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 1/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` does not exist. No evidence of captured learnings or corrections.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/lessons.md` immediately. After any correction or mistake, document the pattern.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 3/5
**Finding:** Test data generator created and run. Progress indicators added. However, no formal test suite exists and no evidence of end-to-end verification runs.
**Recommendation:** Add automated verification commands. Run after each major change.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 4/5
**Finding:** No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Code is clean with clear separation. StreamingAuditor class well-architected. No over-engineering.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 3/5
**Finding:** No git history to evaluate. No failing tests visible. Code appears functional but untested in production.
**Recommendation:** Initialize git repository and commit changes to enable tracking.

### B. Task Management — 2/5
**Finding:** `tasks/todo.md` does not exist. No checkable items, progress tracking, or review sections. Directive→implementation flow exists in conversation but not documented.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/` directory with `todo.md`. Document plans before coding, track progress, add reviews.

### C. Core Principles — 4/5
**Finding:** Changes are surgical and focused. No dead code, temp fixes, or commented-out blocks. Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-storage policy well-enforced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Create `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` immediately.** The code quality is solid (4/5 on Core Principles), but the workflow infrastructure is missing. Without task tracking artifacts, learnings are lost between sessions and verification is ad-hoc.

### Trend Note
First audit — no prior baseline.

## Audit — 2026-02-04 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 4.7/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 4.5   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **4.7** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Excellent plan artifacts. `tasks/todo.md` contains 24 sprints with detailed plans before implementation. Each sprint includes affirmations, constraints, agent assignments, and checkable items. Plans are written before coding (see Sprint 24 checklist created before Dockerfiles). Evidence of re-planning: Sprint 18's "Diagnostic Fidelity" renamed terminology project-wide.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The sprint-based planning with agent assignments is exemplary.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 6 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor). Each has single purpose. Clear evidence of usage: todo.md assigns agents per task (e.g., "BackendCritic: Containerization"). Designer agent created marketing components in Sprint 23.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider logging agent invocations for metrics.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` is comprehensive with 20+ documented lessons spanning Sprints 8-24. Lessons follow the prescribed format with Trigger/Pattern/Example structure. Real corrections captured: "datetime.utcnow() is Deprecated", "framer-motion Type Assertions (Recurring)", "Multi-Stage Docker Builds". Evidence lessons are reviewed: recurring patterns noted across sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The lesson documentation is thorough.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 4/5
**Finding:** Frontend build verification performed (`npm run build`) after major changes. Test suite exists in `backend/tests/`. Review sections added to each sprint in todo.md with "Zero-Storage Verified" checkpoints. However, no evidence of automated CI/CD runs or test execution in recent sprints.
**Recommendation:** Consider adding automated test execution to sprint completion checklist.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code is clean with professional architecture. No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Clear separation of concerns (audit_engine, ratio_engine, flux_engine, recon_engine). Zero-Storage architecture consistently enforced. Multi-stage Docker builds demonstrate production-grade thinking. No over-engineering—components are appropriately sized.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 4/5
**Finding:** Sprint 23 autonomously identified and fixed two type errors (Industry type mismatch, framer-motion type assertion) discovered during build. Fixes documented in lessons.md and todo.md Review section. Limited git history (only 3 commits visible) restricts full evaluation.
**Recommendation:** Commit more frequently to enable better tracking. Consider atomic commits per feature.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** Exemplary task management. All 6 sub-practices present:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint has checkable items before implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Affirmations and constraints documented per sprint
3. **Track Progress** — Items marked complete incrementally (visible checkboxes)
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections explain architectural decisions
5. **Document Results** — Review sections with "Files Created/Modified" lists
6. **Capture Lessons** — lessons.md updated after each sprint

Quick Reference table tracks all 24 sprints. Evidence of cadence matching implementation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. This is the gold standard for task tracking.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Changes are surgical. Sprint 24's Dockerfile is minimal (slim images, no bloat).
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed. Sprint 23 fixed type errors at source, not with workarounds.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes only touch necessary files. Clear file lists in Review sections show focused changes.

Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-Storage architecture enforced at every layer (documented in DEPLOYMENT.md). IP documentation in dev-log.md demonstrates professional-grade due diligence.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Increase commit frequency.** With only 3 commits in git history for 24 sprints of work, the git log doesn't reflect the actual development cadence. Consider atomic commits after each sprint completion to build a proper history trail.

### Trend Note
**Dramatic improvement from prior audit:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 2.8 → 4.5 (+1.7)
- Task Management: 2/5 → 5/5 (+3)
- Core Principles: 4/5 → 5/5 (+1)
- Overall: 2.9 → 4.7 (+1.8)

All gaps identified in the first audit have been addressed:
- ✅ `tasks/todo.md` created and extensively used (was missing)
- ✅ `tasks/lessons.md` created with 20+ documented patterns (was missing)
- ✅ Git repository initialized with commits (was missing)
- ✅ Review sections added to every sprint (was missing)
- ✅ Verification checkpoints documented (was ad-hoc)

## Audit — 2026-02-04 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Exceptional planning discipline. `tasks/todo.md` now tracks 40 sprints (Sprints 1-40 across Phase I, II, and III). Every sprint follows the established pattern: Agent Lead assignments, checkable items before implementation, Review sections after completion. Sprints 36-40 demonstrate consistent plan→execute cadence with atomic commits per sprint.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The sprint-based planning is mature and well-maintained.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure expanded. `.claude/agents/` contains `accounting-expert-auditor` and `project-auditor.md`. Clear evidence of agent usage: todo.md assigns agents per sprint (BackendCritic, FrontendExecutor, FintechDesigner, QualityGuardian). Recent sprints show multi-agent collaboration (e.g., Sprint 39: "FintechDesigner + FrontendExecutor"). Agent specialization is clear and focused.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider documenting agent collaboration patterns.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` remains comprehensive with 20+ documented lessons. Lessons continue to follow Trigger/Pattern/Example format. Evidence of review: recurring patterns (framer-motion types) identified and prevented. The lessons file is actively consulted—similar issues don't recur in recent sprints.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Major improvement from prior audit. Frontend build verification (`npm run build`) executed after every sprint. Backend test suite now at 225 tests. Review sections consistently note "Zero-Storage Verified". Most importantly: **commit frequency now matches sprint cadence**. Git log shows 20 recent commits with atomic sprint-based messages (Sprint 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 all have individual commits).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The commit discipline gap from the prior audit has been fully addressed.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code architecture continues to demonstrate professional quality. Recent additions (BatchUploadContext, RollingWindowAnalyzer, IndustryRatioCalculators) follow established patterns. RFC documents (`docs/BENCHMARKS.md`) show thoughtful design with schema definitions, data source analysis, and implementation roadmaps. No shortcuts or hacky solutions. Zero TODO/FIXME/HACK comments.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The RFC approach for Phase III is excellent.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Self-contained bug fixes visible in git history. Recent sprints show autonomous resolution of TypeScript errors during build verification. No evidence of incomplete fixes or back-and-forth patches. Build passes after every sprint without manual intervention.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** Exemplary task management continues. All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Every sprint has checkable items before implementation
2. **Verify Plan** — Agent assignments and constraints documented
3. **Track Progress** — Items marked complete incrementally
4. **Explain Changes** — Review sections explain decisions
5. **Document Results** — Files Created/Modified lists included
6. **Capture Lessons** — lessons.md updated as needed

Phase II (Sprints 25-39) and Phase III (Sprint 40+) maintain the same discipline established earlier.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Changes remain surgical. Sprint 40's RFC is comprehensive but focused.
- **No Laziness:** Root causes addressed. No temporary fixes visible.
- **Minimal Impact:** Each sprint's git diff shows focused file changes.

Recent additions (batch upload, rolling window, industry ratios, benchmark RFC) demonstrate continued professional quality. Type hints, docstrings, and Zero-Storage compliance maintained throughout.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Maintain current discipline while scaling Phase III.** The workflow infrastructure is now mature. As benchmark implementation begins (Sprints 41-47), continue the sprint-based planning with atomic commits. Consider adding integration tests for the new benchmark comparison features.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score achieved:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 4.5 → 5.0 (+0.5)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 4.7 → 5.0 (+0.3)

Key improvement from prior audit:
- ✅ **Commit frequency increased** — 20 commits now visible (was 3)
- ✅ **Sprint cadence matches commits** — Each sprint has atomic commit
- ✅ **Verification before done** — A4 score improved from 4/5 to 5/5

The primary recommendation from the prior audit ("Increase commit frequency") has been fully addressed. Sprints 36-40 each have their own commit with descriptive messages.

## Audit — 2026-02-05 | 🟢 Excellent | Overall: 5.0/5.0
---

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 was fully planned before implementation. The plan was structured with backend and frontend sections, implementation order, endpoint classification tables, and verification criteria. `tasks/todo.md` was updated at directive start with 10 checkable items, all marked as the sprint progressed. The plan distinguished between endpoints to protect (audit/export), endpoints to upgrade (require_current_user → require_verified_user), and endpoints to leave alone (client/user/settings/reference data). This level of classification before coding prevented scope creep.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure stable at 7 agents in `.claude/agents/` (critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor). Sprint 59's todo.md assigns "BackendCritic + FrontendExecutor" as agent leads. The Agent Council process continues to drive sprint prioritization — Sprint 59's endpoint classification (audit vs client vs reference) reflects the kind of nuanced decision-making the council protocol enables.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` remains active with 20+ structured lessons. Sprint 59 learnings were captured in MEMORY.md with 6 specific patterns: endpoint classification, DEV MOCK removal, structured error detail handling, guest CTA pattern, pre-check pattern, and auth header pattern. These are actionable, concrete, and formatted consistently. The DEV MOCK removal lesson is particularly valuable — it documents a development-to-production transition pattern.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 verification was thorough: `pytest` run (626 passed, 1 pre-existing perf flake identified and correctly excluded), `npm run build` passed with zero errors, and specific test suites verified (32 benchmark API tests confirmed override changes work). The commit message accurately reflects the 8 files changed. The pre-existing performance test flake was correctly identified as unrelated rather than hidden.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 demonstrates excellent surgical precision. The diff is -388/+179 lines — a net reduction. The guest diagnostic zone (300+ lines of duplicated audit UI) was replaced with a 40-line sign-in CTA card. Auth header injection uses a clean spread pattern (`...(token ? { 'Authorization': ... } : {})`). Error handling for structured `detail` objects uses a consistent pattern across 3 files (apiClient.ts, DownloadReportButton.tsx, ExportOptionsPanel.tsx). No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments found. No over-engineering — the pre-check in `handleFileUpload` is a single `if` statement, not an abstraction.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 59 identified and resolved the `[object Object]` error display issue proactively — the structured `detail` from `require_verified_user` would have rendered as `[object Object]` in the UI without the fix to `apiClient.ts`. This was caught during planning, not after a user report. The DEV MOCK removal was also handled autonomously with understanding of its downstream effects (auth flow now works end-to-end). No incomplete fixes or back-and-forth visible in the commit.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Sprint 59 plan written to todo.md with 10 checkable items before any code
2. **Verify Plan** — Endpoint classification table reviewed before implementation
3. **Track Progress** — Items checked off incrementally (8 task tracker items progressed through pending → in_progress → completed)
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit message lists all changes with rationale
5. **Document Results** — todo.md updated with COMPLETE status
6. **Capture Lessons** — MEMORY.md updated with 6 Sprint 59 patterns

Git log now shows 20 sprints with atomic commits (Sprints 41-59), each with descriptive messages.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Net code reduction (-209 lines). Guest diagnostic zone replaced with clean CTA. Auth header pattern reused consistently across files.
- **No Laziness:** Root cause addressed for error display (`[object Object]`). DEV MOCK properly removed instead of worked around. All 19 endpoints classified and handled appropriately.
- **Minimal Impact:** Changes only touch Sprint 59 files. Pre-existing portfolio changes (EditClientModal) correctly excluded from the commit. Reference data endpoints correctly left public.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat & Obsidian design tokens used in the sign-in CTA card. No generic Tailwind colors.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Continue scaling Phase V with Sprint 60 (Homepage Demo Mode).** The auth gating infrastructure is now complete. The guest view currently shows a static sign-in CTA — Sprint 60 should add an interactive demo with synthetic data to demonstrate value before requiring sign-up. This is a marketing/conversion optimization, not a technical debt item.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 3 consecutive audits:**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Project has grown to 626 backend tests + 26 frontend tests (652 total)
- Git history now spans 20 atomic sprint commits (41-59)
- Sprint 59 achieved a net code reduction while adding security features — a sign of mature architecture
- The DEV MOCK → real auth transition is a significant production readiness milestone

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 60 was fully planned before implementation. The plan included a detailed "Demo Narrative" specifying exact data ($5.2M TB, 42 accounts, 3 anomalies, 9 ratios, 8 lead sheets), new file specifications with type imports and component interfaces, modification instructions with exact line references, implementation order (6 steps), and 9 verification criteria. `tasks/todo.md` was updated with 7 checkable items, all marked complete. The plan correctly identified the need for `disabled={true}` props and no-op callbacks.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure stable at 7 agents. Explore subagent used effectively for parallel file reading — 9 files read simultaneously (types, components, hooks, fixtures) to gather type definitions before implementation. This prevented multiple sequential reads and kept the main context clean. Sprint 60 assigned to "FrontendExecutor + FintechDesigner" following the established Agent Council pattern.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** Two new lessons captured in `tasks/lessons.md` from real build errors:
1. **Severity type mismatch** — Frontend `Severity` is `'high' | 'low'` only, not `'medium'`. Documented the cross-stack type discrepancy.
2. **framer-motion ease typing** — `as const` required when extracting variants to module-level consts. Referenced the existing pattern in `ProcessTimeline.tsx`.

MEMORY.md updated with 7 Sprint 60 patterns including the DSO dynamic key workaround and whileInView viewport trigger. Lessons are actionable and reference existing codebase patterns.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** `npm run build` was run 3 times during Sprint 60:
1. First run: TypeScript error on `ease: 'easeOut'` — fixed with `as const`
2. Second run: TypeScript error on `severity: 'medium'` — fixed to `'high'`/`'low'`
3. Third run: Zero errors, build passed

Commit verified via `git show --stat HEAD` — confirmed only 6 Sprint 60 files included (portfolio changes from a prior sprint correctly excluded). Risk summary counts updated to match severity changes.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Sprint 60 demonstrates excellent component reuse. DemoZone renders 4 existing components (RiskDashboard, KeyMetricsSection, BenchmarkSection, LeadSheetSection) with `disabled={true}` rather than reimplementing demo-specific UI. Data separated cleanly into `demoData.ts` (451 lines of typed constants) and presentation into `DemoZone.tsx` (201 lines). The page.tsx change is a net reduction: 46 lines of CTA HTML replaced with a single `<DemoZone />` tag. No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. No over-engineering — the demo data follows the existing test fixture pattern exactly.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** Two TypeScript build errors encountered and resolved autonomously:
1. `Severity` type mismatch: `'medium'` is not a valid frontend severity value. Root cause understood (backend uses medium severity in risk_summary counts, but individual anomaly severity is only high/low). Fixed data to use `'high'` for material anomalies and updated risk_summary counts accordingly.
2. framer-motion ease typing: Recognized that inline JSX infers literal types but module-level consts don't. Applied `as const` pattern already established in `ProcessTimeline.tsx`.

Both fixes were self-contained with no user involvement. No incomplete fixes or workarounds.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained:
1. **Plan First** — Sprint 60 plan written to todo.md with 7 checkable items before coding
2. **Verify Plan** — Component interfaces, type imports, and data schema specified upfront
3. **Track Progress** — 4 task tracker items progressed through pending → in_progress → completed
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit message describes the feature and its purpose
5. **Document Results** — todo.md updated with COMPLETE status and detailed checklist
6. **Capture Lessons** — 2 lessons in lessons.md + 7 patterns in MEMORY.md

Git log now shows 21 atomic sprint commits (Sprints 41-60).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** DemoZone reuses 4 existing components instead of building demo-specific UI. Data constants follow the existing fixture pattern. Page.tsx simplified by replacing 46 lines with 2 lines.
- **No Laziness:** Type errors addressed at the root (understanding frontend vs backend type discrepancies). DSO added via dynamic key access with clear comment explaining why. No shortcuts.
- **Minimal Impact:** Only 6 files in the commit. Portfolio changes correctly excluded. No modifications to existing component interfaces — all components already supported `disabled` prop.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained (hardcoded constants only, no API calls in demo). Oat & Obsidian design tokens used throughout — sage for success/CTA, obsidian for backgrounds, oatmeal for text. Font hierarchy correct (serif for headers, sans for body, mono for financial numbers).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Begin Phase V planning.** Sprint 60 completes the homepage experience — guests now see an interactive demo instead of a static sign-in card. The next priority should be determined by Agent Council consensus, likely focusing on either: (a) frontend test expansion for the new DemoZone/demo data, (b) portfolio UX completion (EditClientModal is uncommitted), or (c) a new Phase V feature based on user feedback.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 4 consecutive audits (2nd audit today):**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Sprint 60 is the recommended follow-up from the prior audit's "Top Priority" (Homepage Demo Mode)
- DemoZone demonstrates mature component architecture — 4 existing components reused with zero modifications
- Two build errors caught and fixed during implementation, both documented as lessons
- Project now has 21 atomic sprint commits in git history

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 5.0   |
| Task Management         | 5/5   |
| Core Principles         | 5/5   |
| **Overall**             | **5.0** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 5/5
**Finding:** Phase VI completed with all 10 sprints (61-70) planned before implementation and executed in order. Sprint 70 (Diagnostic Zone Protection + Phase VI Wrap) was the final sprint, planned with 7 checkable items in `tasks/todo.md`, all marked complete. Phase VII has been fully planned with 10 sprints (71-80), detailed checklist items per sprint, agent assignments, file-level specifications, and estimated test counts — all documented before a single line of implementation code. The Phase VII plan includes a "Not Currently Pursuing" section with 15 features and rationale, demonstrating disciplined scope control. The council review process (Agent Council + CEO approval) was followed before committing the plan.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The Phase VII plan with per-agent action items and file-level specs is the most detailed plan produced yet.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 5/5
**Finding:** Agent infrastructure expanded to 8 agents in `.claude/agents/`: critic, executor, guardian, scout, designer, project-auditor, accounting-expert-auditor, and the newly added future-state-consultant-agent. The Future State Consultant produced a 20-feature catalog that was evaluated against existing infrastructure by the Agent Council — 3 features identified as already built, 2 substantially built, 4 high leverage. This demonstrates agents producing real analytical output, not just being defined. Sprint assignments in Phase VII continue multi-agent collaboration (e.g., "BackendCritic + QualityGuardian" for Sprint 74). The Phase VI close-out was executed by QualityGuardian lead, consistent with its wrap/protection role.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The future-state-consultant-agent → council evaluation → CEO decision workflow is an excellent pattern for strategic planning.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 5/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` now has 25+ lessons spanning Sprints 8-70. The Phase VI retrospective captures two critical architectural patterns: (1) "Frontend auth gating must be 3-state, not 2-state" — distinguishing guest/unverified/verified, and (2) "Wrap-up sprints catch inconsistencies across features built over multiple sprints." Earlier lessons continue to be applied — the `as const` pattern for framer-motion (first documented Sprint 23) was consistently applied in Sprint 66-69 frontend work. The CSPRNG lesson (Sprint 69) documents a regulatory compliance pattern (PCAOB AS 2315) that goes beyond typical development practices.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 5/5
**Finding:** Exceptional verification this cycle. The previously skipped test (`test_failed_login_returns_lockout_info`) was identified, fully implemented, and passes — moving from 1022 passed/1 skipped to 1023 passed/0 skipped. `npm run build` passes with 20 routes. Backend `pytest` runs clean. Sprint 70 commit touches exactly the files listed in the review section (6 files, +102/-21 lines). The Phase VI close-out commit is surgical (3 files, +39/-13 lines). The skipped test was not ignored or deleted — it was implemented as a proper integration test with user registration, failed login, and lockout info assertion.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. The "zero skipped tests" achievement is notable.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 5/5
**Finding:** Code quality remains high. Zero HACK/FIXME comments in the entire codebase (backend + frontend). Only 3 TODO comments exist in frontend — all in non-critical areas (activity log dates, terms/privacy modals). Sprint 70's verification gate follows the exact same pattern established in JE Testing (Sprint 66), demonstrating consistency. The 3-state auth pattern (`isVerified = user?.is_verified !== false`) is a single line that enables the ternary — no over-engineering. The deferred items cleanup deleted 4 stale items that were actually shipped features, showing honesty about what's done vs. what's planned.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 5/5
**Finding:** The skipped test investigation and fix was entirely autonomous. The auditor identified `test_failed_login_returns_lockout_info` as empty with `@pytest.mark.skip(reason="bcrypt compatibility")`, investigated the root cause (harmless passlib warning, not an actual failure), implemented the full integration test (register user → fail login → assert lockout info), and removed the skip decorator. No user involvement required. The JSX fragment wrapping issue in Sprint 70 (multiple siblings in ternary else branch) was also caught and fixed during implementation without escalation.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### B. Task Management — 5/5
**Finding:** All 6 sub-practices maintained at the highest level:
1. **Plan First** — Sprint 70 planned with 7 items before implementation; Phase VII planned with 10 sprints and 100+ items before any code
2. **Verify Plan** — Agent Council consulted for Phase VII prioritization; Future State Consultant features evaluated against existing codebase
3. **Track Progress** — Items checked incrementally across Sprint 70 and close-out tasks
4. **Explain Changes** — Commit messages descriptive: "Sprint 70: Diagnostic Zone Protection + Phase VI Wrap", "Phase VI close-out: fix skipped test, clean deferred items"
5. **Document Results** — Sprint 70 review section lists all 6 modified files with descriptions
6. **Capture Lessons** — Phase VI retrospective with 2 key patterns; 10 lessons added across Phase VI

Git log shows 30+ atomic sprint commits. Phase VII plan includes a "Not Currently Pursuing" log with 15 features and rationale — demonstrating not just what's planned but what's deliberately excluded and why.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### C. Core Principles — 5/5
**Finding:**
- **Simplicity First:** Sprint 70 adds verification gates with a single `const isVerified` + ternary pattern. No new abstractions, no shared verification component — just the same pattern repeated in 2 files (JE Testing already had it). The close-out commit is +39/-13 lines for a test implementation + deferred item cleanup.
- **No Laziness:** Skipped test was not ignored or deleted — it was fully implemented. Stale deferred items were not left to accumulate — they were evaluated by council and cleaned up. Phase VII plan required deep research into 20 features against the existing codebase before prioritization.
- **Minimal Impact:** Sprint 70 touches only 6 files. Close-out touches only 3 files. Phase VII planning touches only 3 files (agent spec, CLAUDE.md, todo.md). No unrelated changes mixed into commits.

Zero-Storage compliance maintained. Oat & Obsidian design tokens used in new UI elements (clay-500 for lock icon, oatmeal-200/400/500 for text, obsidian-800/600 for backgrounds).
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Execute Sprint 71: Financial Statements — Backend Builder + Export.** The Phase VII plan is comprehensive and ready. Sprint 71 has 85% reuse potential from existing lead sheet mapping and ratio engine. The key deliverable is `financial_statement_builder.py` (~200 lines) that transforms existing `lead_sheet_grouping` + `category_totals` into formatted Balance Sheet and Income Statement structures. This is the highest-leverage sprint in Phase VII — it adds a visible capability to Tool 1 with minimal new code.

### Trend Note
**Perfect score maintained across 6 consecutive audits (3rd audit today):**
- Workflow Orchestration: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)
- Task Management: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Core Principles: 5/5 → 5/5 (maintained)
- Overall: 5.0 → 5.0 (maintained)

Notable observations this cycle:
- Phase VI fully completed: 10 sprints (61-70) delivering 2 new tools (Multi-Period, JE Testing) + platform rebrand
- Test count: 1023 backend + 26 frontend (1049 total) with zero skipped — up from 625 + 26 at Phase V end
- Skipped test identified, investigated, and fixed autonomously (1 skip → 0 skips)
- Deferred items audited: 4 deleted (stale/shipped), 1 retained (Multi-Currency)
- Phase VII fully planned with 10 sprints, per-agent actions, and a 15-item "Not Pursuing" log
- 8 agents now in `.claude/agents/` (future-state-consultant-agent added)
- Project version: 0.60.0
