Audit Journal
This file is a append-only log of periodic project audits.
Each entry is generated by the Project Auditor (/audit) and scores the project
against the workflow principles framework.
Entries are ordered oldest-first. The most recent audit is at the bottom.
Do not manually edit prior entries. New entries are appended by the auditor.

## Audit — 2026-02-01 | 🟠 Needs Attention | Overall: 2.9/5.0

### Scores at a Glance
| Pillar                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Workflow Orchestration  | 2.8   |
| Task Management         | 2/5   |
| Core Principles         | 4/5   |
| **Overall**             | **2.9** |

### A1. Plan Mode Default — 2/5
**Finding:** No `tasks/todo.md` exists. No evidence of written plans before implementation. The CLAUDE.md defines a "Conflict Loop" process but no plan artifacts demonstrate its use.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/todo.md` and document plans with checkable items before starting each directive.

### A2. Subagent Strategy — 4/5
**Finding:** 5 well-defined agents exist (critic, executor, guardian, scout, project-auditor). Each has a single purpose. The IntegratorLead protocol in CLAUDE.md shows clear intent to use them.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice. Consider adding invocation logs to track actual agent usage.

### A3. Self-Improvement Loop — 1/5
**Finding:** `tasks/lessons.md` does not exist. No evidence of captured learnings or corrections.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/lessons.md` immediately. After any correction or mistake, document the pattern.

### A4. Verification Before Done — 3/5
**Finding:** Test data generator created and run. Progress indicators added. However, no formal test suite exists and no evidence of end-to-end verification runs.
**Recommendation:** Add automated verification commands. Run after each major change.

### A5. Demand Elegance (Balanced) — 4/5
**Finding:** No TODO/FIXME/HACK comments. Code is clean with clear separation. StreamingAuditor class well-architected. No over-engineering.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### A6. Autonomous Bug Fixing — 3/5
**Finding:** No git history to evaluate. No failing tests visible. Code appears functional but untested in production.
**Recommendation:** Initialize git repository and commit changes to enable tracking.

### B. Task Management — 2/5
**Finding:** `tasks/todo.md` does not exist. No checkable items, progress tracking, or review sections. Directive→implementation flow exists in conversation but not documented.
**Recommendation:** Create `tasks/` directory with `todo.md`. Document plans before coding, track progress, add reviews.

### C. Core Principles — 4/5
**Finding:** Changes are surgical and focused. No dead code, temp fixes, or commented-out blocks. Code reads professionally with clear docstrings and type hints. Zero-storage policy well-enforced.
**Recommendation:** Continue current practice.

### Top Priority for Next Cycle
**Create `tasks/todo.md` and `tasks/lessons.md` immediately.** The code quality is solid (4/5 on Core Principles), but the workflow infrastructure is missing. Without task tracking artifacts, learnings are lost between sessions and verification is ad-hoc.

### Trend Note
First audit — no prior baseline.
