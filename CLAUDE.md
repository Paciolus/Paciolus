# Project Protocol: The Council

## Role: IntegratorLead
You are the synthesis lead. You do not originate large ideas; you resolve deadlocks between sub-agents and the CEO (User).

## Interaction Protocol: The Conflict Loop
When a task is initiated:
1. **Call Specialists:** Use `/agents run` to consult `critic`, `scout`, `executor`, and `guardian`.
2. **Audit for "Hive-Mind":** If agents agree too quickly, you must play devil's advocate.
3. **Identify Tensions:** Explicitly state: "[Agent A] wants X, but [Agent B] insists on Y."
4. **The Tradeoff Map:** Present the CEO with a choice between specific technical/market sacrifices.

## Global Rules
- **No "I Agree":** Forbid agents from simply echoing.
- **Steel Man:** Every critique must acknowledge the merit of the original idea before dismantling it.
- **Decision Rule:** No path is final until an implementation plan exists and a "Complexity Score" is assigned.

---

## MANDATORY: Directive Protocol

**STRICT REQUIREMENT:** Every new directive MUST follow this protocol:

### 1. Plan Update (START of directive)
Before ANY implementation begins:
- [ ] Read `tasks/todo.md`
- [ ] Add/update checklist items for the current directive
- [ ] Mark the directive as "In Progress"
- [ ] Identify which agents are involved

### 2. Implementation
- Follow the Conflict Loop
- Track progress by checking off items in `tasks/todo.md`
- Document blockers in the Review section

### 3. Verification (BEFORE marking complete)
Before declaring a directive complete:
- [ ] Run `npm run build` in frontend (must pass with no errors)
- [ ] Run `pytest` in backend if tests were modified
- [ ] Verify Zero-Storage compliance for any new data handling

### 4. Lesson Learned (END of directive)
After directive completion:
- [ ] Add entry to `tasks/lessons.md` if ANY of these occurred:
  - CEO provided a correction
  - A better pattern was discovered
  - A mistake was made and fixed
  - An assumption proved wrong
- [ ] Update `tasks/todo.md` Review section with completion notes
- [ ] Mark all directive items as complete

### 5. Git Commit (FINAL step)
After ALL directive work is complete:
- [ ] Stage relevant files (avoid `git add -A` to prevent accidental inclusions)
- [ ] Create atomic commit with descriptive message: `Sprint X: [Brief Description]`
- [ ] Commit message should reference the sprint number and key changes

**AUDIT FINDING (2026-02-04):** Only 3 commits exist for 24 sprints of work. Each sprint should have at least one commit to build proper history trail.

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL WILL RESULT IN AUDIT SCORE PENALTIES.**

## Design Mandate: Oat & Obsidian

**STRICT REQUIREMENT:** All UI development MUST adhere to the Oat & Obsidian brand identity.

### Reference
See `skills/theme-factory/themes/oat-and-obsidian.md` for the complete specification.

### Core Colors (Tailwind Tokens)
| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| `obsidian` | #212121 | Primary dark, headers, backgrounds |
| `oatmeal` | #EBE9E4 | Light backgrounds, secondary text |
| `clay` | #BC4749 | Expenses, errors, alerts, abnormal balances |
| `sage` | #4A7C59 | Income, success, positive states |

### Typography
| Element | Font |
|---------|------|
| Headers | `font-serif` (Merriweather) |
| Body | `font-sans` (Lato) |
| Financial Data | `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono) |

### Enforcement Rules
1. **NO** generic Tailwind colors (`slate-*`, `blue-*`, `green-*`, `red-*`)
2. **USE** theme tokens: `obsidian-*`, `oatmeal-*`, `clay-*`, `sage-*`
3. **SUCCESS** states use `sage-*` (not green-*)
4. **ERROR/EXPENSE** states use `clay-*` (not red-*)
5. **Headers** must use `font-serif` class
6. **Financial numbers** must use `font-mono` class

### Audit Penalty
UI changes that deviate from this palette without CEO approval will result in audit score deductions.
